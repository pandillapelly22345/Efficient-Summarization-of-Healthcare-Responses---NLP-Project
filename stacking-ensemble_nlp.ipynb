Answers: An orgasm, also known as a sexual climax, is a pleasurable physical, psychological or emotional response to prolonged sexual stimulation. It is often accompanied by a notable physiological reaction, such as ejaculation, blushing or spasm and may be followed by aftershocks.\n",

      "Both males and females can experience orgasm, but the exact response varies across gender. Generally speaking, orgasm is the third stage of four in the human sexual response cycle, which is the currently accepted model of the physiological process of sexual stimulation You asked two questions that you might think are the same; but they are not. Orgasm is an experience resulting from the combined effects of physical stimulation, emotional bonding, intellectual intimacy and total surrender or giving to the experience of the moment that crest or climax in overwhelming sensual and spiritual thunderclaps.\n",

Later research has suggested that synchrony is caused by some sort of scent cue, or pheromone.\" yea they actually do, it's because each woman gives off hormones, and when there are several living together, for a long time, each of their hormones notices the other hormones and their bodies regulates the hormones to all release at the same time because the same \"mechanism\" is controlling all of the women's bodies.

      "Summarize from the INFORMATION perspective:  Question: how can you releive sciatic pain? Answers: Manual treatments for sciatica, including physical therapy and specific stretching and strengthening exercises, and manual manipulation (e.g. osteopathic or chiropractic manipulation) to help relieve the pressure on the nerve root, which is the cause of the pain. Medical treatments for sciatica, including medications such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), oral steroids, or epidural steroid injections to help relieve the inflammation, which is usually a component of the pain. Surgery for sciatica, such as microdiscectomy or lumbar laminectomy and discectomy, to remove the portion of the disc that is irritating the nerve root. This surgery is designed to help relieve both the pressure and inflammation and may be warranted if the sciatic nerve pain is severe and has not been relieved with appropriate manual or medical treatments. Surgery and meds are the last option IMO! \n",

Massage is also great for sciatica & a well trained massage therapist will be able to give you therapeutic exercises to help manage the pain. \n",

      "Summarize from the SUGGESTION perspective: Specifically, what helps to remove phlegm? Question: What is the best cure of a hacking cough? Answers: You needs a cough syrup that has expectorant(?) such as rubitussin to help loosen the phlegm.Also honey and lemon juice helps. Careful with the expectorants, though they can be a great benefit, just don't overdo it. There's tons of over the counter ones. You can also sit in a hot tub, try for the sauna action with all the steam. To make that even better, they have these tablets you put in the bottom of your shower that are full of eucalyptus or mentholatum, and that breaks it up too, just ask at your local pharmacy. Mint teas help soothe and release, and cayenne, horseradish, garlic and ginger all have things that work up into the sinuses to help stop the phlegm from running down the back of your throat, so as much as you can stomache in soup, etc works wonders. Don't smoke while you're phlegmy. And change your sheets! Any germs you have are harbored there more than anywhere! Stay out of the cold damp as much as possible, and good luck! I hope you feel better! Regular doses of cough syrup and LOTS of liquids.\n",

Answers: I personally was diagnosed with one a few years ago was sent to a cardiologist who said it was nothing to worry about it.  Since then, it was not detected when I had physicals.  I know many people who were diagnosed with them and they were nothing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here's some info from webmd:\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "In particular, they occur in many healthy children, who may or may not outgrow them as adults. They may also occur during pregnancy. Such murmurs are called \"innocent\" heart murmurs. They are not associated with medical or heart conditions, and do not require treatment or lifestyle changes.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Though many murmurs are innocent, some may indicate serious heart problems. For instance, heart murmurs may be caused by blood flowing through a heart valve made leaky or narrow by disease. Murmurs can also be caused by increased blood flow across a valve as a result of medical conditions such as anemia or hypothyroidism. Congenital cardiac defects (heart problems present at birth) can also cause heart murmurs. These often can be repaired with surgery.\n",
      "\n",
      "Within the heart there are four chambers separated from each other by valves, or flaps, that regulate how much blood enters each chamber at any time. Healthy valves also help prevent blood from flowing in the wrong direction in your heart.\n",
      "\n",
      "A healthy heart makes a \"lub-dub\" sound as it beats. The \"lub\" (systolic sound) happens when part of the heart contracts and the mitral and tricuspid valves close, and the \"dub\" (diastolic sound) occurs when part of the heart relaxes and the aortic and pulmonic valves close. A heart murmur is an extra sound, such as a whooshing, in the heartbeat caused by irregular blood flow through the heart valves.\n",
      "\n",
      "Heart murmurs can be heard through a stethoscope and often are detected during routine physical examinations. On further examination, your doctor may find that the heart murmur is innocent. If your heart murmur is related to more serious heart problems, your doctor may refer you to a cardiologist (heart specialist). Medication or surgery may be recommended to treat the underlying problem. He or she may also suggest that you take extra precautions against getting a heart infection, such as by taking antibiotics when you have dental work or some surgeries. With thorough examination and proper tests, your doctor should be able to tell what causes your heart murmur.\n",
      "\n",
      "Symptoms\n",
      "Many people with heart murmurs experience no symptoms. However, some murmurs can occur in conjunction with these other symptoms:\n",
      "\n",
      "    * Chest pain\n",
      "    * Rapid heartbeat (palpitations)\n",

      "    * Bluish skin color or fingertips (sometimes seen in babies with congenital heart defects) it is a hole in the heart murmur is the sound that appear when there is something that disturb the flow of blood when it pass through the valves of the heart It's a sound made as blood flows over a heart valve. Normal heart sounds don't make the \"whoosh\" that a murmur does. Diseased heart valves make eddy currents and so the \"whoosh\" is audible in the doctor's stethescope. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_murmur\n",

Answers: actually its a healthy habit to occationally donate blood,not to mention the number of lives you will be saving yes its ok . No, not in a day. However it is GOOD for your health, not only OK, to donate once in a while. Cleans up your organism. I do it twice a year just to feel fit. In short, yes. The average human body has about 5 pints of blood at any given time. Each individual blood cell has a life span of about 30 days from birth to death. Therefore, you have a completely new supply of blood about every 30 days. So, no matter how much blood you donated/lost, you would be back to normal 30 days later. yeah its absolutely fine, it even help your body. its good to donate blood once a year. not only you help other people who needs blood it even help you too. yes it is ok to donate half a liter of blood yeah you body will make the blood you have donated back in a day or so Ya~ It's ok.. believe it or not..If you lose 1 liter of blood(2 pine), you will get 'shock'\n",

      "Summarize from the INFORMATION perspective:  Question: How do I cure hiccups? Answers: You are gonna get a lot of answers saying to hold your breath, but that only works sometimes and not with every person. Try holding an ice cube to your throat for about 20 to 30 seconds. Also try holding your nose while you take big gulps of water. What I have done for hiccups all my life is swallow saliva immediately after receiving the first hiccup and it goes away. I've done it forever and it works, try it next you get it. And don't over eat it sometimes causes hiccups. Hold your breath. Take a deep breath. Hold your breath under water for 10 minutes. Get a friend to help. Set a glass of water on a table with a straw in it and plug your ears and nose while drinking from the straw, I swear it works. The spoon full of sugar works too, but it's hard to swallow, you'll have to drink water anyway. Holding your breath doesn't really work. Burping does. There are two steps for a hiccup.. let's say you go hic (when you inhale) and then cup (when you exhale) Instead of exhaling the cup, burp it out. Hic, hold the air bubble in your throat and try to make it travel up, and burp it out. If you don't know how to make yourself burp (like myself), get yourself some coke or 7up or sprite, anything gassy to make you burp faster :o) eat one teaspoon of sugar, will provide instant relief! Eat a spoonful of sugar quickly. Your senses will overload with the response from the receptors that the sugar triggered off, and you won't hiccup anymore. focus on your middle name for 5-10 seconds then say it OUT LOUD. if that doesn't work, use brother/sisters middle name. 2 methods, both work, but one is a bit difficult\n",

      "Summarize from the INFORMATION perspective:  Question: I need to know about cnv in new borns.What is it? What caused it? Answers: Choroidal neovascularization (CNV) is normally associated with macular degeneration. Most of the time, this occurs when new blood vessels grow through cracks in tissue layers beneath the retina called Bruch's membrane. As CNV progresses, the abnormal vessels may leak fluid and bleed.  Eventually this process causes damage to the overlying retina. Decreased and/or distorted vision will often occur. As for the cause in a newborn, I would guess that it would be an inherited eye disease. I think that you mean CMV, cytomegalovirus. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is a virus related to the herpes virus group of infections. Like herpes, it is inactive at times, but it is incurable and is a life-time infection. CMV may be passed from a mother to her baby during pregnancy and is the most common congenital viral infection. It is also called congenital cytomegalovirus or cytomegalovirus inclusion disease. CMV without symptoms is common in babies and young children. It is found in saliva, urine, semen, and other body fluids. The virus is easily spread in households and in daycare centers. It can be transmitted to the fetus during pregnancy and to the baby during delivery or in breast milk.\n",
      "\n",
      "Over half of women of childbearing age become infected with CMV at least six months before becoming pregnant. There appear to be few risks for complications of CMV for this group and only a few babies have the infection at birth. These babies appear to have no significant illness or abnormalities.\n",
      "\n",
      "About 90 percent of babies who are infected with CMV have no symptoms at birth. But as many as 15 percent of these babies develop one or more neurological abnormalities — such as mental retardation, learning disabilities, hearing or vision loss — usually in the first year or two of life. Congenital CMV infection is a leading cause of hearing loss in children.\n",
      "\n",
      "About one in 1,000 babies (about 4,000 babies each year) shows symptoms of CMV at birth. These symptoms may include an enlarged spleen or liver, jaundice (yellowing of the skin and eyes), and a distinctive rash. Up to 20 percent of these babies die, and about 90 percent of the survivors suffer from serious neurological defects, such as mental retardation.\n",
      "\n",
      "At present there is no treatment that can halt or reverse the effects of congenital CMV. However, doctors are investigating whether a new antiviral drug called ganciclovir — which is used to treat adults with AIDS who have CMV-related eye infections — also may help babies with congenital CMV.\n",

Eventually this process causes damage to the overlying retina. Decreased and/or distorted vision will often occur. As for the cause in a newborn, I would guess that it would be an inherited eye disease. I think that you mean CMV, cytomegalovirus. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is a virus related to the herpes virus\n",

      "Summarize from the SUGGESTION perspective: She had two ear infections and we're on day 3 of 10 of 800mg total of liquid Amoxicillin.  The infection went away on the first day and the fever went down, but she's having hearing trouble.  Any advice? Question: My 6-year-old daughter had an ear infection and after Amoxicillin is having hearing trouble? Answers: Give it time. With an ear infection you usually have some fluid build up behind the eardrum. Even if the fever is gone, the fluid (and the bacteria in it)can still be there. So the hearing should improve as the fluid goes away and make sure your daughter finishes the full course of the Amoxicillin, or the bacteria in the fluid can start multiplying again and she can end up even sicker than before. I learned this the hard way. If she has had alot of ear infections, i would ask your doc to send her to a specialist. That happened to me over time, and i knew that i couldn't hear well, and it turns out that i had a cyst in my ear canal, and the cyst had damaged my hearing, so they took out 2/3 bones because they weren't fixable.I am doing fine, but it should have been taken care of along time ago.

I thought that we get sick because of the germs in the air and on surfaces.  Which is true? Question: does being cold causes a cold? Answers: A \"cold\" (runny nose, sinus drainage, sneezing, miserable feeling) is called acute rhinitis.  It's a inflammation of the mucous membranes in the nose and throat and is caused by a virus.   \n",
      "\n",
      "There are many viruses that cause head-colds (acute rhinitis) and simply not being warm (no coat, gloves, etc) will not cause you to have acute rhinitis. You must be exposed to the virus before you can \"catch a cold.\" \n",
      "\n",
      "Sneezing causes airborne particles.  Someone who sneezes and has the virus can allow you to get the a cold.  Touching someone or something that has a virus on it can cause you to get a cold (acute rhinitis).\n",

      "The virus enters your body by way of your eye, nose, or mouth. \n",

      "Hand-washing is an excellent way to minimize the chance you'll catch a cold. Both. Yes, you do get colds from airborn or surface viruses. However, your mother is right because being cold will lower your resistance and your immune system. Research has shown that being \"cold\" does not make you more susceptible to colds. I put cold in quotes because cold is a relative term.  For instance, Mom is cold at 72 degrees and that's just too hot for me.  In the research that has been done, \"cold\" is usually around 40 degrees with their feet in cold water. Even spending quite a bit of time like this, people were still no more likely to catch a cold when directly exposed to cold germs.\n",

      "Another reason I point out the relativity of being cold.  This idea has been around a long, long time.

These people were sleeping in temperatures far colder than most people in developed countries can even conceive of.\n",

      "\n",
      "We have no real data, even on whether there really are more colds in the winter.  So it's hard to tell why we get more colds during the winter.  But getting cold doesn't seem to be that much of a culprit. When you are cold, your body can't protect itself as well from illness because it turns its attention to protecting you from the cold itself.

So when you are nervous, anxious or afraid, there is an increase in sympathetic nerve activity in your body as well as an increase in epinephrine secretion from your adrenal gland. These substances act on your sweat glands, particularly those on the palms of your hand and your armpits, to make sweat. Thus, you feel a \"cold\" sweat. Also, the increased sympathetic nerve activity in the skin changes it electrical resistance, which is the basis of the galvanic skin response used in lie detector tests.\n",

      "Summarize from the INFORMATION perspective:  Question: what is inguinal herina.should it treated or not necessary.explain other type of herina? Answers: if you don't get it treated you will have very serious consequences that will eventually be fatal A hernia is a condition in which part of the intestine bulges through a weak area in muscles in the abdomen. An inguinal hernia occurs in the groin (the area between the abdomen and thigh). It is called \"inguinal\" because the intestines push through a weak spot in the inguinal canal, which is a triangle-shaped opening between layers of abdominal muscle near the groin. Obesity, pregnancy, heavy lifting, and straining to pass stool can cause the intestine to push against the inguinal canal.\n",
      "\n",
      "Symptoms of inguinal hernia may include a lump in the groin near the thigh; pain in the groin; and, in severe cases, partial or complete blockage of the intestine. The doctor diagnoses hernia by doing a physical exam and by taking x rays and blood tests to check for blockage in the intestine.\n",
      "\n",
      "The main treatment for inguinal hernia is surgery to repair the opening in the muscle wall. This surgery is called herniorrhaphy. Sometimes the weak area is reinforced with steel mesh or wire. This operation is called hernioplasty. If the protruding intestine becomes twisted or traps stool, part of the intestine might need to be removed. This surgery is called bowel resection. (Bowel is another word for intestine.) Its a protrusion of abdominal content frm inguinal canal. It must be treated to prevent further complications. Another hernia is femoral hernia where the content comes frm femoral canal. There are many other uncomman hernia also.\n",

      "Summarize from the INFORMATION perspective:  Question: Does cheese really cause constipation? Answers: Only if it is eaten in quantity. Cheese, like many other foods are thick binding agents.  The fatter foods move the slowest through the intestinal tract.  Other foods that are good for bulking are noodles, rice, bananas, and peanut butter.

Question: Any help for aging thin cancerous skin that's sensitive to almost everything? Answers: Please listen to me as I am only here to help. You have to do exactly as I say. Go to the website and look up CESIUM CHLORIDE AND OXYGEN DROPS. The other ones could be green algae and paw paw, etc etc. These medicines are known in the medical field, but they dont talk about it. Because these are natural remedies with no toxic chemicals in it. So, thats why they cant profit from it. If they cant profit, they dont sell. I mean, some are even made of mushrooms that you can grow anywhere. Why would they promote this? These doctors will never make money. So, the FDA has put a restriction on these remedies. They cannot say anything about cancer on their labels. They have to be sold as vitamins or health products. But, the website can tell you how to use it, and what cancers it can cure. See how they are suppressing the world? In fact these treatments can cure up to 90% of patients that doctors have already given up on. Chemo therapy is not a therapy. I would rather die then go through with that. They try to kill your cancer with chemicals and radiation. If they kill all your cancer before they kill all your body cells, then they consider you cured. But, what about after that? Your body is damaged and your health deteriorated. There is almost no recovery to this. How many people you know live past 5 years after chemo therapy? Not much if any at all. And compared to the masses, its almost nothing. What do you have to live with after chemo? Your body is not sunburned, its practically microwaved. CESIUM CHLORIDE can be taken with OXYGEN DROPS. Go to the websites. You can go to these websites and they will give a whole package for you to buy. You can take these medicines over the course of 3 months, a year, or whatever they prescribe. After your mom is feeling well, taking it for about 2 months or more, you can almost garauntee that you are cured. But, you have to listen to them and take it till they tell you to stop. They even cure certain 3rd stage cancers with a 90% success rate. But, time is of the essence so I urge you to buy it as soon as possible and take next day delivery or something. I wish you the best of luck in the future. But, heed my warning, do not go into chemo. They always tell you something fuzzy like, oh..you might live another 2 years, or you might die right away..etc etc....Then how do you decide? But, they always say that people who have been on chemo will only live a maximum of X years after that.

You need to eat healthy food, fruit, vegetables, whole grains,(no white bread or sugars). Starches and sugars make your pancreas produce insulin. when that happens your body starts to store fat.\n",
      "Diet and exercise together will produce the best weight loss. Exercise increases your metabolism, burning more calories. It builds muscle which also burns more calories.\n",
      "Try to eat small meals several times a day in stead of 3 large meals. The body will not think you are starving and store fat. Try the rice diet. A cup of rice at meal times, and one piece of fruit (any kind) w/each meal. It is about 1200 calories a day. Do it for a week, and you will see great weight loss. If you cheat, it will take longer naturally. Diet soda, tea is all okay. Then follow healthy eating habits or you will gain lbs. back. I fear what you really may be asking. But I agree, eating a balanced diet is that absolute best way to go. If you want to do somthing drastic, stop eating sugar all together. I lost 21pounds from not eating white flour and products with sugar content in the 4th ingrediant or higher. I didn't exsersize, but remember this it takes 1500 calories to gain or loose a pound and a calorie is a calorie so, eat foods that are nutrient dense vs. foods that are energy dence(high fat) you can eat more that way. \n",

Question: What  are the symptoms Fetal Alcohol Syndrome? Answers: Mental retardation is the most common and serious birth defect associated with FAS.  Perhaps the most notable defects in FAS involve the face and eyes. In general, these defects are obvious and include facial bone hypoplasia (under-development), a long, underdeveloped philtrum (the groove in the middle of the upper lip), a thin upper lip, a short nose, and ptosis (drooping of the eyelids). Although the typical facial features may not be as apparent during the newborn period, they become more prominent as the infant develops. As these children grow into young adulthood, however, the facial abnormalities become more subtle and thereby contribute to the difficulty of recognizing FAS in older persons. With these physical abnormalities come sensory deficits that frequently involve vision, hearing and speech. Hyperacusis (abnormal acuteness of hearing) is common in infants, and approximately one third of these infants have a conductive hearing loss and another one-third have a sensorineural hearing loss. More than 90 percent of infants with FAS have delays in receptive and expressive language development. Please see the links listed below.

      "Summarize from the INFORMATION perspective:  Question: what is aortic valve replacement? Answers: it replaces one of the valves in your heart (which function to move the blood to the rest of the body from the heart) to improve blood flow. The aortic valve is the gateway between the left ventricle and the aorta.  This is where fresh oxygenated blood is pumped out to the entire body.  There are a variety of diseases that can require replacement of this valve, including aortic stenosis where the valve does not properly open and close, or an aortic insufficiency where the valve allows backflow of blood from the aorta back into the left ventricle of the heart.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are two major types of aortic valve replacements - mechanical valves and biologic/tissue valves.  Mechanical valves have been around longer and subsequently have a very refined safety and efficacy profile.  The downside is that after the procedure, the patient must be put on blood thinners for the rest of their life.  Biologic/tissue valves do not need subsequent blood thinner treatment and therefore may benefit younger, generally healthy patients.  However, it has been shown that the durability of tissue valves may be lower than mechanical valves, which may require a repeat operation later in life.\n",
      "\n",
      "There is a variation to the above procedures called the Ross procedure.  This procedure replaces the faulty aortic valve with the patient's own pulmonary valve.  The pulmonary valve is then replaced with a tissue valve.  The rationale for doing this is that more strain is put on the aortic valve and therefore having the person's own anatomy in that place is preferable to having a weaker mechanical or tissue valve.  The pulmonary valve, which only pumps to the lungs (and therefore doesn't have to pump as hard) can withstand having a tissue valve, which isn't as durable.  In addition, this approach does not require blood thinners after the operation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Current cardiac surgery research is trying to investigate if valve replacement can be done in a minimally invasive way using catheter devices. The aortic valve is a semilunar valve that controls blood flow from the left ventricle to the systemic system of the body.. Its only job is to close so that backflow of blood back to the left ventricle will not be attained.. If the valve is not functioning properly the person's diastolic pressure will increase which will ultimately cause a cardiac infarction. The actual replacement can be achieved, but it is a very delicate surgery because the aorta is the biggest blood vessel in the body. Usually an aortic bypass is performed.\n",

Answers: At such a young age it is not the norm to isolate from all people, including family. It could be a form of attachment disorder, and it could be the blossoming of other disorders. A child that exibits such behaviors needs to be assessed for many things. A good child psychiatrist and therapist can test for autism spectrum disorders, but if the child has good verbal skills, that is unlikely. They can also be assessed for attachement disorders, and other types of disorders. Find a good children's center or hospital in your area. There is a more likely chance that your baby does trust you but may have been born with a chemical imbalance. Have you taken her to an ALL natural health practicioner? In the beggining, we 'trust' our mother because we have to for survival.  We know she is our shelter, food, warm body.  This child may be independant or withdrawn but likely wasn't born not attached.  There are some children with disorders such as autism that don't develope natural bonds, but even shy imbalenced children will.  Wait and see.

The disease takes its less-scientific name from Lou Gehrig, a baseball player with the New York Yankees in the late 1920s and 1930s, who was forced to retire in 1939 as a result of the loss of motor control caused by the disease. \n",
      "\n",
      "In 1991, a team of researchers linked familial ALS to chromosome 21. Two years later, the SOD1 gene was identified as being associated with many cases of familial ALS. The enzyme coded for by SOD1 carries out a very important function in cells: it removes dangerous superoxide radicals by converting them into non-harmful substances. Defects in the action of this enzyme mean that the superoxide radicals attack cells from the inside, causing their death. Several different mutations in this enzyme all result in ALS, making the exact molecular cause of the disease difficult to ascertain.\n",
      "\n",
      "Recent research has suggested that treatment with drugs called antioxidants may benefit ALS patients. However, since the molecular genetics of the disease are still unclear, a significant amount of research is still required to design other promising treatments for ALS\n",

      "Itching (pruritus) is the main symptom of cholestasis in many patients. Pruritus is often out of proportion to the level of jaundice (yellow eyes or skin), which is often low-grade and can wax and wane. Scratching starts as digging at the ears and eyes, which are the first areas to show bleeding and scarring. The itching may be very disabling and does not usually respond to medications. The scratching interferes with normal activities and sleep and may interfere with learning and schoolwork. \n",

      "Problems with growth are another major feature of PFIC. Almost all patients are short for their age, but they may not be thin. Delayed puberty and sexual development is common. Patients who are treated can have normal sexual development and several have given birth to normal children. \n",

      "\n",
      "Other common problems include frequent nosebleeds and wheezing. Fat-soluble vitamin (A, E, D and K) deficiencies are common in untreated patients. \n",

      "Vitamin A deficiency can lead to problems with vision. \n",

      "Vitamin E deficiency can lead to problems with balance, strength and coordination. Vitamin D deficiency can lead to poor bone formation. \n",
      "\n",
      "Vitamin K deficiency can lead to bleeding problems. For these reasons, most patients need extra vitamins. Up to a third of patients have gallstones. Most patients have an enlarged liver or enlarged spleen. \n",

      "Although similar, there are differences between patients with BSEP disease and those with FIC1 disease. For example, patients with FIC1 disease are more likely to have watery diarrhea, which can be severe, especially after liver transplantation. However, there is much that we do not yet know about these differences and this will only become clear as more patients are studied.\n",

      "Patients with PFIC but with high serum GGT have been called PFIC3, and are now called MDR3 disease. These patients have very bad cholestasis in the first year of life, which may progress in the first few years of life toward failure of the liver to do its normal functions. However, there are probably less severe forms of MDR3 disease that cause milder disease. The child and his family may first become aware that there is something wrong during school age or adolescence. Sometimes, problems may not appear until adulthood. The full spectrum of liver problems caused by MDR3 disease is just now becoming known.\n",

      "Summarize from the INFORMATION perspective:  Question: How do you overcome panic attacks? I've struggled with them for years.? Answers: I have not had a panic attack in four years.  Where counseling and drugs failed, information worked.  I took a college class on abnormal psychology, and that helped me objectify panic attacks as biological overreactions that had nothing to do with who was really me.  I sincerely hope this helps! you should get away from everything that makes you panic, or just call a doctor they could help you I would recommend Louise Hay's \"Self-Esteem Affirmations\" on CD. You can listen to it over and over again and the positive messages get into your subconscious. I also recommend \"Feel the Fear and Do It Anyway\" by Susan Jeffers. It teaches you to repeat \"I'll Handle It\", which is very helpful during a panic attack.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have suffered from panic attacks for over 3 years and the above suggestions are the only thing that have helped me. meditate Panic attacks are extremely frightening and often very disabling. Suggested methods for overcoming them depend on vairous factors including - how frequent the attacks are, what disruption they cause in your life and whether they are associated with any particular situation. If your panic attacks are repititive and frequent you may have consulted a mental health professional. Psychological therapies and medication are the two main methods used. Psychological therapies like relaxation training and Exposure and response prevention aim at recognition and working through a panic attack, so that they eventually decrease in frequency. Medication is used if psychological therapies do not work, if the attacks are very  severe or in conjunction with psychological treatment. Common ones have included antidepressants such as Fluoxetine, venlafaxine etc. I would steer clear of benzos as they may be habit forming and one quickly gets habituated to their actions.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the end the best person to contact may be your psychiatrist or psychologist. I have no knowledge of any other methods though they exist and information is available on the web. I have had panic attacks also. I would highly recommend trying several natural strategies before doing any prescription medication. There is a great book called \"Natural Relief for Anxiety: Complementary Strategies for Easing Fear, Panic & Worry\" that outlines various strategies.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, one of the most immediate things you can do is to cut out caffeine, alcohol, cigarettes and any drugs. These things obviously disrupt any physical and mental balances.\n",
      "\n",
      "Second, exercise exercise exercise. There is a lot of scientific data that says *vigorous* exercise can really be the most effective way to clean up your head and also strengthen your heart. Regular exercise (I recommend swimming as the most effective) will definitely strengthen your heart, put your blood pressure at normal levels and reduce any sensations of heart palpitations that are associated with panic attacks.\n",
      "\n",
      "Third, take at least 2 hours per day to relax/meditate. I would recommend a combination of yoga, a soak in a hot bath or hot tub and a nap in quiet room with nothing but candles, very soft relaxing music. Turn off the phone, turn off the lights, lock the doors, just relax, breath, meditate. If you can afford massage, I think that is a way to complement this relaxation time.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fourth, when you actually have a panic attack, try this very simple strategy. First say to yourself over and over \"Everything is fine, it's just a panic attack. People have them everyday. It's uncomfortable but it will pass very soon.\" As you repeat this to yourself, breathe in very deeply and very slowly ... breath in for 4-5 seconds, hold for 4-5 seconds and release for 4-5 seconds. Do this sequence 20 times in a row. It will quickly reduce your heart rate and increase oxygen flow to your brain which in turns increases your rationality, thereby reducing your irrationality (the panic).\n",

      "Fifth, read the book I recommend. There are some special diet stratgies, possible food allergies that could be involved and vitamin/mineral supplements that can help you.\n",

Answers: some women do not always produce enough lubrication themselves, so personal lubricants replace what the woman is not producing. it is very uncomfortable to have sex when there is not enough lubrication, so it is made to help people who don't produce enough. Usually there is moisture in your vagina.  And during oragsm there is secretion and acts like lubricant.

I just moved to a big city don't know anyone, so going out with friends is tough right now, plus I work a lot of weird hours with the same old boring people.  What has worked for you?  any tapes I could buy or something. Question: How do you stop being depressed? Answers: How long is a piece of string? Because that's what you're asking. Forget Jesus too. I mean faith has nothing to do with this. And why the heck do those trolls come here? Anyway, what it comes down to is what state your mental condition is in right now and how it impacts on your quality of life. Obviously it's not too bad at the moment because you've managed to cope with a big move, new city, and no friends around you. Doesn't sound like a person not in complete control of their life to me. Gee, can I ask what exactly you are depressed about?\n",
      "\n",
      "So, my point is that you can only be helped if you're willing to let others help you. This of course means taking advice from someone in a professional enough position to comment on your condition (e.g. how bad it is). Sure, you may need medication or you may not. Why do you refuse to take drugs anyway? You know eventually you may not even have a choice in taking some. Have you thought about that?\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, my opinion is that I think the first thing you need to do is forget about 5 minute solutions. Depression doesn't work like that. And if you think it does, well, perhaps you need to seek a different diagnosis. A professional one perhaps? I mean Joe Public can only help so much. for me iam at my happiest when i play with video games. but mainly long walks-up to 6 miles 3-4 times a day. plus i get involve with yahoo answers and feel better too. yes i understand ur situation, i would suggest u to join Yoga classes, i bet it will help you. i personaly would suggest The Art of living organisation. check out the link u will findout more. Don't worry, be happey!! I also move to another county years ago and I know what you are talking about. just do not stay at home, go out.... force yourself to go out... go and do some volunteer job where you can find freinds or take classes... just get out Try reading this book: The only way that I have ever been able to get out of depression is when I focus on Jesus. I pray and talk to him. It seems to be the only way becuase other wise there isn't a whole lot of hope in life. You need to find something within yourself that makes you happy.  Don't search for other people or places to make you happy -- it has to come from within.  Once you find something within yourself that makes you happy, the friends and other things start to fall into place.  Search for your own hope in a higher power such as God.

I also move to another county years ago and I know what you are talking about. just do not stay at home, go out.... force yourself to go out... go and do some volunteer job where you can find freinds or take classes... just get out Try reading this book: The only way that I have ever been able to get out of depression is when I focus on Jesus. I pray and talk to him. It seems to be the only way becuase other wise there isn't a whole lot of hope in life. You need to find something within yourself that makes you happy.

However if the infection should get to your ears, which wouldn't be uncommon, it can affect the vestibular system, thus making you dizzy.

      "Summarize from the EXPERIENCE perspective:  Question: What's the best remedy for arthritic hands? Answers: Well, it's basically an inflammation.  Anti-inflammatories like ibuprofen can be an enormous help.  Unfortunately, oral administration distributes the drug to the whole body, and the place where you need it can be under-treated.  Plus, ibuprofen and aspirin can cause stomach problems if you start raising the dosage.  \n",
      "\n",
      "There is a solution- topical administration.  Ask your doctor for a prescription for ibuprofen cream.  It is usually called something else, like ketoprofen, and can be made with a topical pain-reliever such as bupivicane (like lidocaine).  Keep in mind your doctor may not have heard of it, and that it has to be compounded.  Check your phonebook for local compounding pharmacies so that you can give your doctor their phone number. Typically the cream comes as 10-20% active, which is possible because it will never be in your stomach to cause problems.  Unfortunately, because it has to be compounded, your insurance company will probably not cover it in the same way as regular drugs.  You may be looking at paying $50 for a 4oz jar. \n",
      "\n",
      "When you apply- be sure to really rub and massage the cream into your hands hard for 5-10 minutes.  This will help just as much as the ibuprofen will, because the muscle work will greatly increase blood flow to the area.  Together, massage and anti-inflammatory therapy can provide great relief.\n",

      "Results vary with patient.  I hope you find it useful. i have always wore a metal bracelette around mine and it always works for me I worked for two different Rheumatoligists in my career and found there is no ONE remedy.

      "Summarize from the INFORMATION perspective:  Question: What's the best remedy for arthritic hands? Answers: Well, it's basically an inflammation.  Anti-inflammatories like ibuprofen can be an enormous help.  Unfortunately, oral administration distributes the drug to the whole body, and the place where you need it can be under-treated.  Plus, ibuprofen and aspirin can cause stomach problems if you start raising the dosage.  \n",
      "\n",
      "There is a solution- topical administration.  Ask your doctor for a prescription for ibuprofen cream.  It is usually called something else, like ketoprofen, and can be made with a topical pain-reliever such as bupivicane (like lidocaine).  Keep in mind your doctor may not have heard of it, and that it has to be compounded.  Check your phonebook for local compounding pharmacies so that you can give your doctor their phone number. Typically the cream comes as 10-20% active, which is possible because it will never be in your stomach to cause problems.  Unfortunately, because it has to be compounded, your insurance company will probably not cover it in the same way as regular drugs.  You may be looking at paying $50 for a 4oz jar. \n",

      "When you apply- be sure to really rub and massage the cream into your hands hard for 5-10 minutes.  This will help just as much as the ibuprofen will, because the muscle work will greatly increase blood flow to the area.  Together, massage and anti-inflammatory therapy can provide great relief.\n",

Answers: it really depends on how far along she is.If she isn't that far then tell her sleep any way she is comfy.When she starts to show or around 4-5 months, most doctors say never sleep on your stomach,sleeping on your back is usually uncomfortable if she is very far along because it can make it hard to breathe. they say the best way is on your side,and they sell pregnancy pillows that make it more comfortable and keep you on your side. Visit the link below. If she is feeling dizzy, or can't breathe she needs to not lay on her back (especially if she is pretty far along). The best position is a side lying position with a pillow behind her, maybe one between her legs or under her knee that comes over while she is on her side. ... im confused with this question... elaborate a little more? umm she lies her head down, closes her eyes and sleeps... i think that may be how she does it lol\n",

There are currently 2.2 million people suffering from Schizophrenia in the US today.  Worldwide, the disease affects about 1% of the population. Schizophrenia is a chronic, severe, and disabling brain disease. Approximately 1 percent of the population develops schizophrenia during their lifetime – more than 2 million Americans suffer from the illness in a given year. Although schizophrenia affects men and women with equal frequency, the disorder often appears earlier in men, usually in the late teens or early twenties, than in women, who are generally affected in the twenties to early thirties. People with schizophrenia often suffer terrifying symptoms such as hearing internal voices not heard by others, or believing that other people are reading their minds, controlling their thoughts, or plotting to harm them. These symptoms may leave them fearful and withdrawn. Their speech and behavior can be so disorganized that they may be incomprehensible or frightening to others. Available treatments can relieve many symptoms, but most people with schizophrenia continue to suffer some symptoms throughout their lives; it has been estimated that no more than one in five individuals recovers completely. \n",

I'll tell you what I told her. Finish high school. Then take some college courses. Get a job.

Getting involved with a volunteer organization will get you out of the house and helping others with bigger needs than yours.

There are lots of activities for the parent to get involved with there, along with being with other parents who are going through some of the same things.

You can help her with some of the chores that are maybe a little difficult for her. The thing is to do something with your life that's meaningful to you and your child.

      "hard to talk? Question: do braces hurt???? Answers: yes yes yes. But not horribly painful. you get used to them and they become easier to talk with. the pain is only when they get tightened and until you get used to them. They give you wax to put around the spots that hurt you when your tongue rubs against the brackets and you won't feel the pain. They hurt for a bit when you first get them.They feel tight.Then, they settle down. However, they hurt each time you get them adjusted for a few days afterward. But,dont worry,you'll get used to the pain. yes yes they hurt when u first get them but then u get used 2 them really  easily. sometimes u like drool or spit or something but unless u have a pallete expander u can talk normal. if u have 1 ur \"K's\" get all screwed up. Yes THEy HuRt WhEn YoU fIrSt GeT them but just for a few days...If you eat something hard and it gets stuck in them it mite hurt...and also after youy get them tightened..but they do not make it hard to talk, only retainers do that!!! at the begining you feel really weird and it hurts a little bit but then you get used to them\n",
      "is not hard to talk at all you can talk normally I had them...they hurt for a bit when you first get them...feel tight.  then, they settle down.  However, they hurt each time you get them adjusted for a few days afterward. I just got my braces a few days ago. They felt like they were loose for the first two days, and it was really hard to eat. I got over speaking difficulties quickly, although the inside of your mouth gets kind of scratched and torn- don't fret, it heals quickly enough.

      "Summarize from the INFORMATION perspective:  Question: what are the symtoms of testicular cancer? Answers: Testicular cancer is one of the most common cancers in young men between the ages of 15 and 35, but the disease also occurs in other age groups, so all men should be aware of its symptoms. While testicular cancer is common among young men, young men typically do not develop any kind of cancer, so overall, testicular cancer is a relatively rare disease. This form of cancer is almost always curable if it is found early. Most testicular cancers are found by men themselves, either as a painless lump, a hardening or change in size of the testicle, or pain in the testicle. Children born with an undescended testicle have an increased risk of getting testicular cancer, regardless of whether surgery is done to correct the problem. However, the surgery should still be done to preserve fertility. The theory is that the increased risk of testicular cancer is due to whatever caused the undescended testicle, not just by the fact that the testicle was undescended. Common symptoms include a swelling and/or lump in one or both of the testes, a feeling of heaviness in the scrotum, and a dull feeling of pain in the region of the lower abdominal area, groin, or lower back. Pain in the testes or scrotum may or may not be present. No touching your balls mister...I've got my eye on you. im pretty sure bumps on the testicles\n",

Answers: Cough is a natural phenomena to bring out any foreign body or any secretion from the lower respiratory tract.  In asthma, there is narrowing of the lower respiratory tract, and the secretions are small in quantity and sticky in nature which also reduces the lumen of the respiratory tract. So to bring that expectoration out cough is produced.  Since it is sticky in nature the person  coughs severely. Some things that can trigger coughing in asthma patients are dust, cold air, overexcertion, perfume, pollen and other enviromental factors.

A number of muscle tendons and an important nerve called the median nerve pass through this tunnel.  Compression of the median nerve results in carpal tunnel syndrome.  The fastest way to fix this is by surgery in which the surgeon cuts the flexor retinaculum, loosening the covering of the carpal tunnel. Ewww no. Listen not about any surgeries. It's not necessary. Sublingual B12 works very good for carpal tunnel. Overdose on B12 for at least 3-5 days or until the pain goes away. Take about 2500 mcg split into at least 2 different dosages in a day. You will not accumalate too much B12. Anything your nervous system doesnt need will come out in your p.\n",

      "Summarize from the INFORMATION perspective:  Question: what is Fifth Disease? Answers: It is a infectious disease-mostly kids get--with a rash on feet, hands and mouth--it goes away in about 14 days--no big deal What is \"fifth disease?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Fifth disease is a mild rash illness that occurs most commonly in children. The ill child typically has a \"slapped-cheek\" rash on the face and a lacy red rash on the trunk and limbs. Occasionally, the rash may itch. An ill child may have a low-grade fever, malaise, or a \"cold\" a few days before the rash breaks out. The child is usually not very ill, and the rash resolves in 7 to 10 days.\n",
      "\n",
      "What causes fifth disease?\n",
      "\n",
      "Fifth disease is caused by infection with human parvovirus B19. This virus infects only humans. Pet dogs or cats may be immunized against \"parvovirus,\" but these are animal parvoviruses that do not infect humans. Therefore, a child cannot \"catch\" parvovirus from a pet dog or cat, and a pet cat or dog cannot catch human parvovirus B19 from an ill child.\n",
      "\n",
      "Can adults get fifth disease?\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, they can. An adult who is not immune can be infected with parvovirus B19 and either have no symptoms or develop the typical rash of fifth disease, joint pain or swelling, or both. Usually, joints on both sides of the body are affected. The joints most frequently affected are the hands, wrists, and knees. The joint pain and swelling usually resolve in a week or two, but they may last several months. About 50% of adults, however, have been previously infected with parvovirus B19, have developed immunity to the virus, and cannot get fifth disease.\n",
      "\n",
      "Is fifth disease contagious?\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes. A person infected with parvovirus B19 is contagious during the early part of the illness, before the rash appears. By the time a child has the characteristic \"slapped cheek\" rash of fifth disease, for example, he or she is probably no longer contagious and may return to school or child care center. This contagious period is different than that for many other rash illnesses, such as measles, for which the child is contagious while he or she has the rash.\n",
      "\n",
      "How does someone get infected with parvovirus B19?\n",
      "\n",
      "Parvovirus B19 has been found in the respiratory secretions (e.g., saliva, sputum, or nasal mucus) of infected persons before the onset of rash, when they appear to \"just have a cold.\" The virus is probably spread from person to person by direct contact with those secretions, such as sharing drinking cups or utensils. In a household, as many as 50% of susceptible persons exposed to a family member who has fifth disease may become infected. During school outbreaks, 10% to 60% of students may get fifth disease.\n",
      "\n",
      "How soon after infection with parvovirus B19 does a person become ill?\n",
      "\n",
      "A susceptible person usually becomes ill 4 to 14 days after being infected with the virus, but may become ill for as long as 20 days after infection.\n",
      "\n",
      "Does everyone who is infected with parvovirus B19 become ill?\n",
      "\n",
      "No. During outbreaks of fifth disease, about 20% of adults and children who are infected with parvovirus B19 do not develop any symptoms. Furthermore, other persons infected with the virus will have a non-specific illness that is not characteristic of fifth disease. Persons infected with the virus, however, do develop lasting immunity that protects them against infection in the future.\n",
      "\n",
      "How is fifth disease diagnosed?\n",
      "\n",
      "A physician can often diagnose fifth disease by seeing the typical rash during a physical examination. In cases in which it is important to confirm the diagnosis, a blood test may be done to look for antibodies to parvovirus. Antibodies are proteins produced by the immune system in response to parvovirus B19 and other germs. If immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibody to parvovirus B19 is detected, the test result suggests that the person has had a recent infection.\n",
      "\n",
      "Is fifth disease serious?\n",
      "\n",
      "Fifth disease is usually a mild illness that resolves on its own among children and adults who are otherwise healthy. Joint pain and swelling in adults usually resolve without long-term disability.\n",
      "\n",

Practitioners draw on \"reiki energy\" channeling it to areas of need in themselves and their patients.

These differences by sex have been reducing in recent years, with men's life expectancy improving at a faster rate than women's. Poverty and inequality has a very substantial effect on life expectancy. In the United Kingdom life expectancy in the wealthiest areas is ten years longer than the poorest areas and the gap appears to be increasing as life expectancy for the prosperous continues to increase while in more deprived communities there is little increase.

      "Summarize from the SUGGESTION perspective: Is there any life insurance company that will accept a person undergoing cancer treatment? Question: Is there a life insurance for people with cancer.? Answers: Depends on the type of cancer and how far along the treatments are.  The best bet is to contact a local life agent and give them all the information. Don't try to hide anything because it could result in a denial of payout down the road.  A local agent can talk with their underwriter to determine if they can write the policy and at what health class. Buy term life insurance.  Its relatively cheap, like 25 buxx a month depending on age.  Go and get about 4 or 5 different policies if you think this person is going to die.  Because they pay really low.  Like 20 grand if the person dies.  But, if they die in less then 2 years,  I think its only like 2000 plus how much you paid per month for every month that you paid.  So, if you paid 25 a month for 6 months, and the person dies, they give you only 2000 plus 150.  But if you can buy 4 or 5 of these, you can find 10 grand to bury this person.  These are the only insurance companies that will sell to you because they dont have to pay back anything to you.  If you cancel with no death, they owe you nothing.\n",

      "Summarize from the SUGGESTION perspective:  Question: WHat kind of sit-up is the best and most effective? Answers: Well, situps are a waste of time.  Some people do like as much sit ups as they can to achieve that 6 pack.  And to be honest, some never get it.  Its cuz the muscles arent big enough to show a 6 pack.  There was never enough resistance to get it.  I dont recommend any type of sit ups.  I do a kung fu style push up that gives you the best results.  Imagine, everybody can do like 10 or 20, maybe 100 sit ups, but with this, some cannot even do one.  But, just because you cant do one doesnt mean you havent done any work.  Eventually, after trying every day, you will be able to do one.  And then 2, 3, and slowly you work your way to like 25.  You only need to do about 15 to 20 per day to keep that 6 pack after its there.  You lay flat on the floor on your stomach.  Then you prop your feet up in push up position.  Now you put your hands out there on the floor.  Now put them together so that they are just touching.  Now, try to do a push up.  Keep your back as straight as possible.  When you first do this, your back will have a tendency to bend because you are trying to do at least one.  Hehe.  Um, I used to be able to do 50 of these easy.  After I get it, it was a cinch.  It will take you like 1 to 2 minutes a day trying to do like 20.  Thats all it takes to keep your 6 pack.  I used to do crunches.  Elbows to knees.  They arent bad, but this is far better.

Some people do like as much sit ups as they can to achieve that 6 pack.  And to be honest, some never get it.  Its cuz the muscles arent big enough to show a 6 pack.  There was never enough resistance to get it.  I dont recommend any type of sit ups.  I do a kung fu style push up that gives you the best results.

If you go to the e.r. ask them to give you amoxicillin or something along those lines. these are very cheap like 10.00. maybe less. I would advise that you not take them.  As pills age, they lose their potency.  Also what you may have now, might not be treatable with this particular antibiotic.  Best thing to do would be to see your doctor.\n",

      "Summarize from the EXPERIENCE perspective: I had mono like 5 years ago and my doctor said that I will have Chronic fatigue my entire life because of that. But they didn't give me any cures. Is this true? Question: Does Mono give you Chronic Fatigue? Answers: Yes it can cause it, but not always. I was constantly tired for a long time and went to the doctor and he tested me for everything under the sun and tried to then tell me that I was mentally ill. I kept telling him that I had TWO bad bouts of Mono in my life. FINALLY he tested me for Epstein Barr virus antibodies. Epstein Barr is the same as mono, which is short for infectious mononucleosis. An antibody is something your body usually produces when it is trying to fight off something, but after the virus goes away, usually the antibodies will lie dormant. Well, I had no virus in my blood, but I had TONS of the antibodies, still running around in my bloodstream. This can and does cause Chronic Fatigue Immune Disorder. Not at all... the fatigue associated with it does go on for quite a while, but when I had mono, I was completely back to normal within a year. Yes, if you don't rest while you have the mono.  If you properly took care of yourself while you were sick there is no reason why you should have chronic fatigue.  If you do actually have chronic fatigue, there aren't any cures.

      "First you should wash out any rott or germs in your teeth with warm salt water, then you might want to consult with your dentist because some people have ways that work for them but trust me everyones teeth are differant. You should try flossing, brushing after every meal and remember to brush your gums for a healthier flow so you can`t get any cavities or gum rott. Don`t worry if your teeth bleed when you floss you probably just haven`t flossed enough, and remember to brush for atleast 2-3 minutes. If you want cleaner healthier teeth you also might want tobrush up and down and not side to side or circles. I used Crest whitestrips for a few months before my wedding and they did the job, but they gradually became stained again.  I think you'd probably only have to do it once a year or so.  Plus, I drink a LOT of tea. it maybe kinda funny  but it works 4 me.. try using charcoal.. rub it on ur teeth... its a cheaper way you know! haha.. I used the Crest Whitestrips Premium & had really wonderful results! My dentist was pleased & noticed right away how much brighter my smile was. He said they wouldn't hurt the enamel.

Question: Does anyone know the best way to lower blood sugar naturally?

When your blood sugar is high, and you are not taking any insulin (which is I assume is what you are doing), and then you exercise, you are actually making things much worse. Excercising while your sugar is high causes your body to produce ketones. Since you don't have any insulin on board, then your body begins to starve and breakdown fat for energy. The result is ketosis which can be fatal. You need to have some insulin in you, or all the exercise in the world won't help a bit! Observe how much meat you are eating.

      "Summarize from the INFORMATION perspective:  Question: Are Chiropractors real doctors? Answers: No It depends on what you define as a \"real doctor.\"  A chiropractor is a DC, doctor of chiropractic.  A chiropractor is not a medical doctor (M.D.) or a doctor of osteopath (D.O.), so a chiropractor CANNOT prescribe medication. I guess it depends on what your definition of a real doctor is.  Some people would only consider you a doctor if you could prescribe drugs.  However, that is the difference in philosophical understanding between chiropractors and medical doctors.  Medical doctors use an \"Outside-In\" approach with drugs or surgery to attempt to reduce symptoms, whereas chiropractors use an \"Inside-Out\" approach to restoring normal function of the body so it can heal itself.  Chiropractic is not a panacea or \"cure-all\", but regardless of what your condition or situation is, if you have poor communication between your brain and body due to misalignments of your spine, your chiropractor can certainly help.  \n",

Answers: Avian influenza (also known as bird flu, avian flu, influenzavirus A flu, type A flu, or genus A flu) is a flu due to a type of influenza virus that is hosted by birds, but may infect several species of mammals. It was first identified in Serbia Montenegro in the early 1900s and is now known to exist worldwide. A strain of the H5N1-type of avian influenzavirus that emerged in 1997 has been identified as the most likely source of a future influenza pandemic and is known to have infected 133 people in Asia since late 2003, killing 68.[1]\n",
      "\n",
      "The avian influenza subtypes that have been confirmed in humans, ordered by the number of known human deaths, are: H1N1 caused Spanish flu, H2N2 caused Asian Flu, H3N2 caused Hong Kong Flu, H5N1, H7N7, H9N2, H7N2, H7N3. Bird Flu \n",
      "Hundreds of thousands of birds in Asia died due to a virus that has been dubbed the \"bird flu.\" The highly contagious illness is responsible for wiping out large numbers of poultry in Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Vietnam. The particular strain of influenza which has been reported as causing the deaths is called H5N1. Humans can contract the disease through close contact with infected birds, or with the feces of infected birds. It is not known to spread through human-to-human contact. There has been no indication that humans would get the disease through eating eggs or meat of sick birds.\n",
      "\n",
      "The only known way to eradicate the disease is by culling infected flocks. Thus far millions of chickens, ducks and other kinds of poultry have been culled in an effort to eliminate the virus. There have been several deaths due to the flu and the World Health Organization has expressed concern that the virus could latch on to a human influenza virus, potentially causing a serious epidemic. The bird flu's symptoms in humans include fever and coughing and eventual pneumonia.\n",

      "Summarize from the INFORMATION perspective: what causes hiccups??? anyone know.. i was always told its your heart skipping a beat is this true?????? Question: what causes the hiccups? Answers: A hiccup or hiccough (generally pronounced \"hiccup\" independent of the spelling) is an involuntary spasm of the diaphragm; typically this repeats several times a minute. The sudden rush of air into the lungs causes the glottis to close, creating the \"hic\" noise. A bout of hiccups generally resolves by itself, although many home remedies are in circulation to shorten the duration, and medication is occasionally necessary. By extension, the term \"hiccup\" is also used to describe a small and unrepeated aberration in an otherwise consistent pattern. The medical term is singultus.\n",
      "\n",
      "While many cases develop spontaneously, hiccups are known to develop often in specific situations, such as eating too quickly, taking a cold drink while eating a hot meal, eating very hot or spicy food, laughing vigorously or coughing, or drinking an excess of an alcoholic beverage. Hiccups may be caused by pressure to the phrenic nerve by other anatomical structures, or rarely by tumors. Irrition to your diaphragm causes hiccups. \n",
      "\n",
      "The diaphragn pulls down when you inhale to help pull air into the lungs, and it pushes up when you exhale to help push air out of the lungs. \n",
      "\n",
      "But when your diaphragm gets irritated it pushes up in a jerky way causing a hiccup. Hiccups are sudden, involuntary contractions of the diaphragm muscle. As the muscle contracts repeatedly, the opening between your vocal cords snaps shut to check the inflow of air and makes the hiccup sound. Irritation of the nerves that extend from the neck to the chest can cause hiccups.\n",
      "🔷 T5 Summary: In information, hiccups are caused by involuntary spasms of the diaphragm. The diaphragm pulls down when you inhale to help pull air into the lungs, and it pushes up when you exhale to help push air out of the lungs. However, when the diaphragm gets irritated, it pushes up in a jerky way causing a hiccup.\n",

      "As with any diet, it works best if you eat sensible portions and exercise. Low carb diets are based on the premise that a diet very low in carbohydrate leads to a reduction in the body's insulin production, resulting in fat and protein (muscle) stores being used as its main energy source Foolishness. Carbs are not necesarily bad for you unless you get the type that is. You must look up waht not eat or ask your doctor, or a nutritionist. Low carb diet” (also called “reduced carbohydrate” or “controlled carbohydrate”) is a broad term, encompassing many popular diet books (examples: Atkins, South Beach, Zone, Protein Power, Sugar Busters, Carbohydrate Addicts Diet) as well as eating plans that don’t follow a rigid format, but advise limiting the consumption of foods with a lot of carbohydrate. Some diets limit the amount of overall carbohydrate, while others focus on certain types of foods, generally ones high in starch and sugars, such as the “No White Foods” approach. Still others focus on how glycemic the diet is.\n",
      "\n",
      "It’s important not to equate “low carb” with the very low carb phase of some popular diets. These phases are usually meant to be quite short, with more carbohydrate phased in after that. Other diets begin at a higher level of carbohydrate, but still less than the USDA Food Pyramid suggests. Any diet whose primary focus is the reduction of carbohydrate in any way is what is meant by “low carb” on this site. In terms of percentages, since the usual “mainstream” recommendation is a diet with 50-65% calories from carbohydrate, I consider a diet with 40% or less energy from carbs a “low-carb diet”, though most of them don’t measure it in this way. The natives in Alaska, I think their called the Inuit, live off of only meat which has no carbs. Though this diet doesn't seem to fair well with most others accustomed to a eurasian diet. And you can get scurvy if you cook the meat, strangley enough. The meat tends to lose their vitamins when cooked.\n",

When a person's CD4+ T cell count falls below 200/mm3, he or she becomes particularly vulnerable to the opportunistic infections and cancers that typify AIDS, the end stage of HIV disease.

People act like herbs are some dangerous stuff that should be avoided like the plague. I never did understand their problem with it. I grew up dealing with herbs and their benefits so I don't see the problem, other than the fact that people are narrow-minded and scared of taking something that has been around forever. i would deffiently ask your doctor you dont want to take a chance of something going wrong, You need to be very careful and are best to consult with a Federally licensed Naturopathic Physician (N.D.)who is trained in the medicinal use of herbs and familar with prescription medications.

      "\n",
      "Lack of water can lead to dehydration, a condition that occurs when you don't have enough water in your body to carry on normal functions. Even mild dehydration — as little as a 1 percent to 2 percent loss of your body weight — can sap your energy and make you tired. Dehydration poses a particular health risk for the very young and the very old. Signs and symptoms of dehydration include:\n",

      "Every day you lose water through sweating — noticeable and unnoticeable — exhaling, urinating and bowel movements. For your body to function properly, you need to replace this water by consuming beverages and foods that contain water. So how much water, or more precisely fluid, do you need?\n",
      "\n",
      "This isn't an easy question to answer. A healthy adult's daily fluid intake can vary widely. Most people drink fluid to quench thirst, to supply perceived water needs and \"out of habit.\" At least three approaches estimate total fluid (water) needs for healthy, sedentary adults living in a temperate climate.\n",
      "\n",
      "Replacement approach. The average urine output for adults is 1.5 liters a day. You lose close to an additional liter of water a day through breathing, sweating and bowel movements. Food usually accounts for 20 percent of your fluid intake, so you if you consume 2 liters of water or other beverages a day (a little more than 8 cups), along with your normal diet, you can replace the lost fluids. \n",
      "Eight 8-ounce glasses of water a day. Another approach to water intake is the \"8 x 8 rule\" — drink eight 8-ounce glasses of water a day (about 1.9 liters). The rule could also be stated, \"drink eight 8-ounce glasses of fluid a day,\" as all fluids count toward the daily total. Though this approach isn't supported by scientific evidence, many people use this basic rule as a guideline for how much water and other fluids to drink. \n",
      "Dietary recommendations. The Institute of Medicine recommends that men consume 3 liters (about 13 cups) of total beverages a day and women consume 2.2 liters (about 9 cups) of total beverages a day. These guidelines are based on national food surveys that assessed people's average fluid intakes. I have to disagree with most of the people I guess. Drinking cold water does suppress appetite because it sits in your stomach longer and makes you feel fuller. Your stomach has to heat it up before your body can process it, so it can trick your stomach into curbing the urge for munchies. No, it doesn't kill your appetite. Depending on the climate in which you live you should drink 8 or more cups of water a day. you shud drink about half a gallon of water a day\n",

      "Summarize from the INFORMATION perspective:  Question: does drinking a lot of water kill your appetite? how often should i drink it? Answers: No. It doesn't.\n",
      "\n",
      "Though no single formula fits all people, several guidelines are available to help you estimate how much to drink each day. Delve into your daily fluid needs to learn how your body uses water and what factors may increase — or decrease — your water requirements.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lack of water can lead to dehydration, a condition that occurs when you don't have enough water in your body to carry on normal functions. Even mild dehydration — as little as a 1 percent to 2 percent loss of your body weight — can sap your energy and make you tired. Dehydration poses a particular health risk for the very young and the very old. Signs and symptoms of dehydration include:\n",
      "\n",
      "Excessive thirst \n",
      "Fatigue \n",
      "Headache \n",
      "Dry mouth \n",
      "Little or no urination \n",
      "Muscle weakness \n",
      "Dizziness \n",
      "Lightheadedness \n",
      "\n",
      "Every day you lose water through sweating — noticeable and unnoticeable — exhaling, urinating and bowel movements. For your body to function properly, you need to replace this water by consuming beverages and foods that contain water. So how much water, or more precisely fluid, do you need?\n",
      "\n",
      "This isn't an easy question to answer. A healthy adult's daily fluid intake can vary widely. Most people drink fluid to quench thirst, to supply perceived water needs and \"out of habit.\" At least three approaches estimate total fluid (water) needs for healthy, sedentary adults living in a temperate climate.\n",
      "\n",
      "Replacement approach. The average urine output for adults is 1.5 liters a day. You lose close to an additional liter of water a day through breathing, sweating and bowel movements. Food usually accounts for 20 percent of your fluid intake, so you if you consume 2 liters of water or other beverages a day (a little more than 8 cups), along with your normal diet, you can replace the lost fluids. \n",
      "Eight 8-ounce glasses of water a day. Another approach to water intake is the \"8 x 8 rule\" — drink eight 8-ounce glasses of water a day (about 1.9 liters). The rule could also be stated, \"drink eight 8-ounce glasses of fluid a day,\" as all fluids count toward the daily total. Though this approach isn't supported by scientific evidence, many people use this basic rule as a guideline for how much water and other fluids to drink. \n",
      "Dietary recommendations. The Institute of Medicine recommends that men consume 3 liters (about 13 cups) of total beverages a day and women consume 2.2 liters (about 9 cups) of total beverages a day. These guidelines are based on national food surveys that assessed people's average fluid intakes. I have to disagree with most of the people I guess. Drinking cold water does suppress appetite because it sits in your stomach longer and makes you feel fuller. Your stomach has to heat it up before your body can process it, so it can trick your stomach into curbing the urge for munchies. No, it doesn't kill your appetite. Depending on the climate in which you live you should drink 8 or more cups of water a day. you shud drink about half a gallon of water a day\n",

      "Summarize from the INFORMATION perspective: i get these really bad headaches everyday, why is that? Question: why do i have headaches everyday? Answers: If your Doctor said that it is not migrains then it is probably tension headaches.  This is cause by contraction of some of the back muscles related to stress such as Trapezius, semispinalis capitits, splenious capitis etc.. Basically this tension that most probably is triggered by some sort of stress puts pressure on a spinal nerve coming out of the spinal cord that inhibits the optimum potential of your body to function properly.. Chiropractic uses a non invasive procedure to remove that nerve interference and permit the body to function in harmony without obstruction.. Chiropractic is proven and documented by peer reviewed journals to be effective with patients that have headaches.. What you don't want to do is rely on medication because your body will adapt to the chemicals and you'll always have to take them to feel normal.. Don't forget about the side effects that all medications have especially to the liver!!!! Get your spine checked and the headaches will go away.. Because alll girls are always in pain.   I learned this when i began dating.  Girls always are going through some sort of pain. I have headaches every day too. I have sinus, allergies,lots of stress,and bad eyes. These are all different causes of headaches. Even high blood pressure can cause headaches, could be many different reasons.  Have a doctor check it out. Is there enough protein in your diet?

      "Summarize from the CAUSE perspective:  Question: how can I ensure that a part of my body gets suffecient blood? Answers: Generally there are 2 reasons why a part of your body might lack blood, physical and chemical.  Physical reasons might be that the part of your body may be too tight to allow for good circulation.  In this case, you must stretch (eg. yoga or pilates) and exercise to loosen up that area.  Doing heat pack will also help to aid the blood flow temporarily.  One important thing to remember though is that the source of tightness might be completely unexpected.  If you have cold hands, it may be more helpful to stretch your calves or your shoulders depending on your body structure rather than the hand itself.  You must remember to treat your body as a whole.  Chemical reasons could come from your diet or the air you breathe or any other intake (eg. tobacco or drugs).  This could alter the chemical make up of your bloodstream.  In this case, what you would have to do is to remove the chemical that is causing the problem.  What part of your body is lacking sufficient blood? Walking gets the blood flowing, or even swimming.  Walking is great exercise but swimming works out all of your body\n",

      "A word of caution: Several studies have linked aspirin use to the development of Reye's syndrome in children recovering from flu or chickenpox. Reye's syndrome is a rare but serious illness that usually occurs in children between the ages of 3 and 12 years. It can affect all organs of the body but most often the brain and liver. While most children who survive an episode of Reye's syndrome do not suffer any lasting consequences, the illness can lead to permanent brain damage or death. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends children and teenagers not be given aspirin or medicine containing aspirin when they have any viral illness such as the common cold.

Wash your hands before applying a compress. Use a clean cloth or piece of gauze moistened with warm tap water.

Would I have had an outbreak by now? Question: Would I have had a herpes outbreak by now?? Answers: I say you get off the internet and get checked out you may have something more serious than herpes with a fever and diarhea. Drs. have to be confidential about your problem so go out of town if your scared someone will see you at the clinic. It can take up to two to three weeks for herpes to erupt with physical lesions after being infected, so it is possibly too soon to have an outbreak.  However everyone responds differently to herpes in the initial infection phase, and some people never break out (about 25%), and many only have very mild symptoms, yet they are contagious (called asymptomatic viral shedding).  So even if you don't see an outbreak, that doesn't mean you don't have herpes.  If you had contact with someone who you think might have had herpes, you should get tested as soon as you do see any kind of lesion, where they can sample the fluid directly and test it for herpes virus.  If you don't break out, you need to wait about 8 to 12 weeks from the time you were exposed to get a blood test done for herpes antibodies.  It will tkae that long for your body to produce a detectable level with high certainty.  Be sure to get an antibody test for both herpes 1 and 2, that tests for IgM antibodies.  The standard in this case is a test called the the HerpeSelect antibody test.\n",

      "Summarize from the INFORMATION perspective:  Question: why do we fart? Answers: QUOTE: \"Well, for starters, the gas that makes up a fart comes from two sources: more originates from the breakdown of food by the digestive system, and some is from swallowed air. In the first case, foodstuffs are broken down by enzymes, stomach acids, and intestinal bacteria in order for the energy in them to be made available to the body. Through the processes of digestion and fermentation, gases can be liberated from what's eaten. In the second case, air that a person swallows from eating, drinking, breathing, chewing gum, and being stressed, among other ways of entry, that's not expelled during a burp travels through the stomach and intestine, transforming into fart-ready mode. In either case, the gases flow down through the rest of the digestive tract and eventually exit the body - Poof! Ping! Pfft! Toot-toot! Kaboom! - expelled as a fart, or farts. And this silent or noisy expulsion of air can help bring about some relief and comfort from a buildup of gas within the lower part of the body.\" What exactly is a fart? The word \"fart\" can stand for: Frequency Actuated Rectal Tremor. Farting, also known as flatulence, is the act of passing intestinal gas from the butt. Intestinal gas comes from several sources: air we swallow, gas that seeps into our intestines from our blood, gas produced by chemical reactions in our guts, and gas produced by bacteria living in our guts. Burps are not farts that come out your mouth. They have to do with your stomach. The feces is decaying, and thus gives off gas, when enough gas is built up, it come out.\n",

      "Summarize from the INFORMATION perspective: Can anyone tell me how to know if I need a counselor? I need to find ways to try to stop my family from arguing and fighting absolutely constantly with each other (me, husband, 2 kids), ways to feel better about myself, not feel like a failure at life, and feel happy and enjoy each day.  Any thoughts on picking a counselor, or? OR, does anyone have any suggestions that might be helpful for those things?  Thanks! Question: Do I need a counselor...? Answers: It is very difficult to change the behaviors of others. It is much more effective to think about why this bothers you so much, and to change the way you feel about and react to their arguing. Family counseling might not be a bad idea if your other family members agree that this is a problem and are interested in changing. But counseling does not work unless those involved have a legitimate interest in changing themselves. I suggest calmly discussing with your family how much of a problem this is for them, and find out if they are interested in changing THEMSELVES rather than changing OTHERS. If so, counseling is for you. If not, you could certainly consider going by yourself to work on strategies to deal with the stress and anxiety this causes you. I think counseling would be a great place to start, and also perhaps some family couseling.  Look through the phone book for family counselors.\n",

      "Summarize from the INFORMATION perspective: It's a common agreement that the high prices of drugs is what makes it so desirable, specially for trafficants. If it were legalized the price will come down so much that it wouldn't be a business anymore, and it's a fact that, when something is easily available it loses its attractiveness. Question: Should Cannabis be legalized? Give reasons why yes or not.? Answers: i dont agree with the above quate, \"First comes Cannibus then comes Cocain\" sorry , but i hate to tell ya my first drug was \"COCAINE\" that led me to marijuana, and when i found that i no longer wanted cocaine, no lie, but on to the questions, Yes i do think it should be legalized reasons. \n",

      "ANY WAY HELL YEAH LEGALIZE..!!!! there is not enough reasons for it to be kept illegal. more so, it has a lot of medicinal benefits sure-legalization equals taxation. then we should tackle prostitution Even though I wouldn't smoke it even if it were legalized (I'm asthmatic) I wouldn't oppose its legalization as long as its use is restricted to adults who are not driving or operating dangerous machinery. I believe that marijuana usage can dangerously impair someone who is driving and should have the same restrictions that we currently have for alcoholic beverages.\n",
      "   By the way, I would never be in favor of legalizing drugs like cocaine, heroine, crystal methamphetamine or ecstasy unless they could be proven to have a medical benefit and be used under the supervision of physicians. No , because mostly who begins with Cannabis ; finish with Cocain . The problem lies within the governing of it. How does uncle Sam get a piece of the action? If it were to be legalized, people would grow it at home or in hiding like they do now. Who would buy it for a high taxed price when they can get it cheaper on the street? Absolutely!!!  No one has ever died using cannabis.  It has MANY medicinal benefits.  But we must hold a person accountable for his actions, even under the influence of cannabis.  This includes wreckless driving or stealing munchies from the mini-mart.  They cannot say that the cannabis made them do it.\n",

Answers: All tea comes from the same plant--black, green, and oolong teas all have the same parents. The difference in the teas lies in how the teas are prepared after picking. Black and oolong tea are fermented, but Green tea is not. Therefore the active constituents remain unaltered in green tea. The most important ingredient in green tea is the phytonutrient eppigallocatchin or EGCG for short. This substance is a polyphenolic compound that acts as an antioxidant.\n",

However in this new research, Professor Roger Thornley in England states, “We have shown for the first time that EGCG, which is present in green tea at relatively high concentrations, inhibits the enzyme DHFR or dihydrofolate which is a recognized, established target for anti-cancer drugs. This is the first time to our knowledge a known target for an anti-cancer drug has been identified as being inhibited by EGCG.” The scientist continued by saying that EGCG is probably just one of a number of anti-cancer mechanisms in green tea.\n",

However, morning sickness usually begins around the sixth week and fluttering feelings within the abdomen can usually be felt around the 16-20th week.

Among various mycotoxins, aflatoxins have assumed significance due to their deleterious effects on human beings, poultry and livestock. The aflatoxin problem was first recognized in 1960, when there was severe outbreak of a disease referred as \"Turkey 'X' Disease\" in UK, in which over 100,000 turkey poults were died. The cause of the disease was shown due to toxins in peanut meal infected with Aspergillus flavus and the toxins were named as aflatoxins.\n",

Among 18 different types of aflatoxins identified, major members are aflatoxin B1, B2, G1 and G2. Aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) is normally predominant in amount in cultures as well as in food products. Pure AFB1 is pale-white to yellow crystalline, odorless solid. Aflatoxins are soluble in methanol, chloroform, actone, acetonitrile. A. flavus typically produces AFB1 and AFB2, where as A. parasiticus produce AFG1 and AFG2 as well as AFB1 and AFB2. Four other aflatoxins M1, M2, B2A, G2A which may be produced in minor amounts were subsequently isolated from cultures of A. flavus and A. parasiticus. A number of closely related compounds namely aflatoxin GM1, parasiticol and aflatoxicol are also produced by A. flavus. Aflatoxin M1and M2 are major metabolites of aflatoxin B1 and B2 respectively, found in milk of animals that have consumed feed contaminated with aflatoxins. Aflatoxins are naturally occurring mycotoxins that are produced by many species of Aspergillus; but most notably Aspergillus flavus and Aspergillus parasiticus. Aflatoxins are toxic and carcinogenic to animals, including humans. After entering the body, aflatoxins are metabolized by the liver to an intermediate reactive, aflatoxin M1, an epoxide. if you live in the united states, who cares?

Answers: While there is no evidence that a fetus is affected by its mothers' exposure to either the natural sun or indoor tanning equipment, a potential drawback to tanning during pregnancy may be the risk of the woman's body overheating. Pregnant women are cautioned to avoid prolonged sauna and whirlpool exposure due to the possible harm to the fetus from the rise in the woman's core body temperature. Core body temperature is the temperature of the blood as it is pumped from the heart, which normally ranges from 99 to 100 degrees Fahrenheit. Extended periods of sauna or whirlpool exposures or prolonged vigorous exercise may actually cause this temperature to rise. This rise in body temperature could result in developmental damage or possibly death to the fetus.

Answers: Haldol and prolixin are antipsychotic drugs, also formerly known as \"major tranquilizers\".  They are the same class of drug as the animal tranquilizers used to shoot a wild tiger, etc. with to render him so calm that anything can be done with him, as if he was a pet.  These drugs will calm any kind of agitation or excitement, such as the mania of a bipolar (manic depressive).  These drugs make you like a zombie.  You may still be awake, but your emotions are paralyzed.  There is no special effect on manic depressives. These drugs should not be used without strong reason to do so, as they can cause permanant neurological impairment, called Tardive Dyskinesia, where a person has involuntary movements usually of his mouth and face, even tounge.  Also, these drugs cause temporary Parkinson like effects, making the user stiff, and making it difficult to initiate movement like getting out of a chair as well as akathesia, where the patient is very restless and can't sit or lay still.

      "Summarize from the INFORMATION perspective:  Question: what is thephysiology of thirst? Answers: Thirst and drinking function to maintain body water balance and are basic to survival. Thirst is often associated with a dry unpleasant-tasting mouth and the feeling of a need to obtain water; it can result from dehydration, decreased vascular volume, dry mouth, pharmacologic agents, or inappropriate activation of the thirst mechanism. Drinking involves the motor activities that culminate in ingestion of liquids. Thirst sensation and drinking are influenced by many factors, including the temperature and taste of a liquid. Thirst may be discomforting in persons with limited fluid intake, diminished in some elderly persons, and inappropriate in persons who are compulsive water drinkers. Although nurses are commonly confronted with client complaints of thirst, there has been minimal nursing research that relates to assessment of thirst and drinking behaviors, nursing diagnoses for thirst, or nursing interventions for persons with altered thirst or drinking behaviors.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thirst is the sensation indicating the body's need for water. Dry or salty food and dry, dusty air may induce such a sensation by depleting moisture in the mucous membranes of the mouth and throat. Relief through ingestion of water is only temporary, however, if thirst results from a generalized depletion of water in the system. About three fourths of the body is composed of fluids, and the average adult requires 21/2 qt (2.4 liters) of fluid per day, supplied by water, other beverages, and foods. Depriving the body of water interferes with its metabolism and functions, causing dehydration, which is eventually fatal. The unnatural thirst that accompanies fever, diabetes, and other disorders is caused by a rapid reduction of the body fluids. The sensation of thirst is controlled by osmoreceptors in the hypothalamus in the brain. Dehydration of the cells triggers the posterior pituitary to releast the antidiuretic hormone (ADH). To put it simply, you loose water, it concentrates your blood and your brain detects this concentration (osmolality) and sends a signal to drink and to also limit excretion of water.  Its caused by the salt concentration of our blood as sensed by the brain.  IF you are thirsty, you are 1% dehyradted.\n",

      "True Summary: For information purposes, an orgasm is a pleasurable response to sexual stimulation, involving physical, emotional, and sometimes spiritual reactions. Both genders can experience it, but the specific response varies. It's the third stage in the human sexual response cycle, influenced by physical touch, emotional connection, mental intimacy, and complete involvement in the moment. Various factors like thoughts of procreation, power dynamics, and genuine love can contribute to the experience. While having orgasms with someone you love can be great, it doesn't guarantee the long-term success of a relationship.\n",

However, the term \"angust\" has become obscure in older literature. It is often associated with a similar intensity of emotional excitement, but the exact response varies across genders.

This synchronization is thought to be influenced by scent cues or pheromones. Studies have shown that women living in close proximity, such as in dorms or workplaces, may experience a convergence of their menstrual cycles over time. The mechanism behind this phenomenon is not fully understood, but it has been suggested that hormonal signaling plays a role.\n",
      "BART Prediction: Synchronous menstruation is observed among mothers, sisters, and daughters who live together, and sometimes among women who simply work together.\n",
      "T5 Prediction: It is suggested that synchrony occurs when multiple women live together for a long time, for a long time, each of their hormones notices the other hormones and their bodies regulate the hormones to all release at the same time because the same mechanism is controlling all of the women's bodies.\n",

      "True Summary: Hypothyroidism, characterized by insufficient production of thyroid hormones, can lead to weight gain and fatigue due to a slowed metabolism. As metabolism naturally slows with age, maintaining an active lifestyle becomes crucial to prevent weight gain and associated complications. The assertion that you don't need to diet to lose weight suggests the importance of focusing on nutrient-dense foods rather than restricting calories excessively. Achieving the minimum nutrient requirements necessitates consuming around 5000 calories a day from the right sources, which is impractical in today's food environment. The statement also emphasizes that dieters, often characterized by poor eating habits and meal skipping, might struggle to meet their nutritional needs. Depending on factors like height and weight, the average woman requires around 100 grams of lean protein daily, 7-9 servings of fruits and vegetables, and at least one gallon of water to support overall health.\n",

      "True Summary: While being active is beneficial, it's advised to consult a doctor for personalized weight loss guidance. To enhance weight loss efforts, consider incorporating additional strategies, such as walking for 30 minutes before evening meals, experimenting with food combinations, and trying various exercise routines.
