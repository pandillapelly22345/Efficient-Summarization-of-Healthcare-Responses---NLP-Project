        "Thirst and drinking function to maintain body water balance and are basic to survival.",
        "Thirst is often associated with a dry unpleasant-tasting mouth and the feeling of a need to obtain water; it can result from dehydration, decreased vascular volume, dry mouth, pharmacologic agents, or inappropriate activation of the thirst mechanism.",
        "Drinking involves the motor activities that culminate in ingestion of liquids.",
        "Thirst sensation and drinking are influenced by many factors, including the temperature and taste of a liquid.",
        "Thirst may be discomforting in persons with limited fluid intake, diminished in some elderly persons, and inappropriate in persons who are compulsive water drinkers.",
        "Although nurses are commonly confronted with client complaints of thirst, there has been minimal nursing research that relates to assessment of thirst and drinking behaviors, nursing diagnoses for thirst, or nursing interventions for persons with altered thirst or drinking behaviors.",
        "Thirst is the sensation indicating the body's need for water.",
        "Dry or salty food and dry, dusty air may induce such a sensation by depleting moisture in the mucous membranes of the mouth and throat.",
        "Relief through ingestion of water is only temporary, however, if thirst results from a generalized depletion of water in the system.",
        "About three fourths of the body is composed of fluids, and the average adult requires 21/2 qt (2.4 liters) of fluid per day, supplied by water, other beverages, and foods.",
        "Depriving the body of water interferes with its metabolism and functions, causing dehydration, which is eventually fatal.",
        "The unnatural thirst that accompanies fever, diabetes, and other disorders is caused by a rapid reduction of the body fluids.",
        "The sensation of thirst is controlled by osmoreceptors in the hypothalamus in the brain.",
        "Dehydration of the cells triggers the posterior pituitary to releast the antidiuretic hormone (ADH).",
        "To put it simply, you loose water, it concentrates your blood and your brain detects this concentration (osmolality) and sends a signal to drink and to also limit excretion of water.",
        "Its caused by the salt concentration of our blood as sensed by the brain."
