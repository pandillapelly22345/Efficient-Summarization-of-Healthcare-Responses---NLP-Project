        "An orgasm, also known as a sexual climax, is a pleasurable physical, psychological or emotional response to prolonged sexual stimulation. It is often accompanied by a notable physiological reaction, such as ejaculation, blushing or spasm and may be followed by aftershocks.\n\nDictionaries still give the subsidiary meaning, \"a similar point of intensity of emotional excitement,\" but as of 2005 this usage has become obscure. It can be startling to modern readers when encountered in older literature.\n\n\nGeneral\nBoth males and females can experience orgasm, but the exact response varies across gender. Generally speaking, orgasm is the third stage of four in the human sexual response cycle, which is the currently accepted model of the physiological process of sexual stimulation",
        "You asked two questions that you might think are the same; but they are not. Orgasm is an experience resulting from the combined effects of physical stimulation, emotional bonding, intellectual intimacy and total surrender or giving to the experience of the moment that crest or climax in overwhelming sensual and spiritual thunderclaps.\n\nMany concepts may play a role in building orgasm, including thinking about making a baby, dominance and submission, etc.\n\nTrue love might be a component of a good orgasm, but is itself different and in the long term more fundamental than the orgasm. Having orgasms with someone you love is wonderful, but the existence of the orgasms does not in and of itself serve to indicate whether the relationship will endure over a long term."

Of seven female lifeguards who started out one summer with widely scattered periods. Three months later they were all menstruating within four days of one another.\n\nA study of 135 residents of a women's college dorm confirmed the effect.

This makes all three human bodies more efficient from the \"mechanisms\" view point."

        "It sure can - read this... it tells you what else can cause ulcers and explains what an ulcer is.  My uncle had to stop soda altogether because of this (good luck!):\n\nAn ulcer is an open wound that develops in the tissue of a digestive tract. \n\nThere are two main types of ulcers- \n\nPeptic or gastric ulcers, they form in the stomach. The gastric juice that is produced in the stomach contains hydrochloric acid, mucus, and an enzyme called pepsin. Sometimes, the mixture of pepsin and acids acts on the wall of the digestive tract and the result is a peptic ulcer. \n\nDuodenal ulcer forms in the small intestines near the stomach. They are more common than gastric ulcers. \n\nHow do you know if you have an ulcer? Pain! The pain may occur from 30 to 60 minutes after eating. The pain rarely comes in the morning, but usually follows after lunch and dinner. And it may occur after midnight. \n\nIntense burning pain occurs in the area of the lower chest and/or upper abdomen. Additional symptoms that may be experienced are weight loss, a decrease in appetite, anemia, nausea, and vomiting. \n\nThere may be times when the pain of an ulcer seems to be gone and then it suddenly returns. Pain associated with ulcers affect different people in different ways. \n\nThere are different causes for the formation of ulcers. In some cases the bacterium \"H. pylori\" is responsible for the majority of ulcers. It says that too much stomach acid aggravates the already existing problem. People who develop ulcers usually have a higher concentration of hydrochloric acid than is normal. \n\nSome medications are known to cause ulcers such as those used to relieve the swelling of arthritis. Aditionally care should be taken when using ibuprofen and aspirin since they can cause irritation and bleeding. \n\nTense, ambitious, hard-driving people are more likely to develop ulcers than calm people. Other causes are alcoholic beverages, caffeine, stress, and smoking. Drinks that often contain caffeine are soda, tea, and coffee. Chocolate also contains caffeine and should be avoided. \"The American Medical Association Family Medical Guide\" adds that the elderly are more susceptible to developing a stomach ulcer. People who do not eat regular meals or who are rushed during mealtime are also likely candidates for this type of ulcer. \n\nAlthough uncers can bleed, bleeding due to a stomach ulcer is rare, but it can be very serious. An ulcer that bleeds slowly over a period of time, may eventually lead to anemia, weight loss, decrease in appetite, and infection. A more serious complication of a persistent gastric ulcer is stomach cancer. \n\n\n\nWhen a duodenal ulcer goes untreated, the risks are low. However, bleeding from duodenal ulcers can cause anemia. Heavy bleeding from this type of ulcer may cause nausea, vomiting, and dark stools. Scarring from a duodenal ulcer can also cause a dangerous blockage. \n\nIf you find the above mentioned symptoms, contact the doctor. Immediate medical attention should be given if the patient is vomiting blood, has cold skin accompanied by sweating, faintness, weakness, or is experiencing extreme pain. Early diagnosis and treatment is essential for prompt healing and also to prevent the ulcer from coming back. \n\nThe above is provided for your information, but you are responsible for your own actions to deal with your ulcers or gastro esophageal health problems.  Our information is not medical advice.  You must see your own doctor for medical advice about your gastro esophageal or ulcers.",
        "I don't know...but 8 is TOO MUCH.\n\n# Aspartame/Nutrasweet is not very sweet in itself, that may be why Equal puts Dextrose (sugar) and maltodextrin as the first ingredients, so that it tastes sweet.\n\n# Aspartame/Nutrasweet is a brain drug that stimulates your brain so you think that the food you're eating tastes sweet. If you pay attention you'll notice that when using Aspartame/Nutrasweet, everything you eat at the same time also tastes sweet! This may be why Aspartame/Nutrasweet causes you to crave carbohydrates. Hence, you won't lose weight using it.\nBTW, cyclamates got pulled off the market in the 70's in the US (but not Canada or the rest of the world) because the sugar industry saw too much of their market disappear.\n\n# Aspartame/Nutrasweet (aspartylphenylalanine-methyl-ester) breaks down to its poison constituents at 86 degrees (Aspartic Acid 40%, Phenylalanine 50%, and Methanol 10%). Remember your stomach is at 98.6 degrees! Therefore you should never use Aspartame/Nutrasweet in hot beverages or cooked foods such as Jello. How the FDA allows this remains a mystery. There is mounting evidence that the \"Burning Mouth Syndrome\" experienced by the Desert Storm troops was actually Methanol poisoning from the Diet Coke they drank lots of, after being exposed to desert temperatures.\n\n# Aspartame/Nutrasweet's 10% Methanol appears in the body quickly and is the same alcohol (wood alcohol also in lacquer thinner), that your mother correctly warned you could make you blind. Many skid-row alcoholics had major problems with this cheap but deadly form of alcohol.\n# Aspartame/Nutrasweet's 40% Aspartic Acid is an \"excitotoxin\" in the brain and excites neurons to death, i.e. it kills brain cells and causes other nerve damage.\n\n# Aspartame/Nutrasweet triggers Migraine Headaches This even happened to me!. The Usenet is filled with posts by people who have pinned their migraines down to aspartame/Nutrasweet consumption.\n\n# Aspartame/Nutrasweet's breakdown products attack the bodies tissues and create Formaldehyde which builds up in the tissues forever. Remember the smelly, eye watering fumes from the frogs you dissected in school? They were preserved with Formaldehyde! Formaldehyde is thought to cause cancer.\nThe American Bottlers Association did not want the FDA to approve Aspartame/Nutrasweet because of what the test report showed. But the FDA approved it anyway!\n\n# Airline pilots stay away from Aspartame/Nutrasweet because they are well aware of the documented dangers.\n\n# Aspartame/Nutrasweet also breaks down to diketopiperazine [DKP] which is proven to cause Brain Tumors! Brain Tumors used to be rare. Several of the rats in the original study formed brain tumors during their Aspartame/Nutrasweet exposure. The researchers surgically removed the tumors and returned the rats to the study and discounted the tumors",

        "I'm with Scorpio on this one.  Addiction is defined as the compulsive need for and use of something that is psychologically or physically habit-forming, characterized by tolerance and by well-defined physiological symptoms upon withdrawal; Being abnormally tolerant to and dependent upon a habit forming substance (such as the endorphins caused by throwing up, or the habit forming behavior of bingeing and the fear of gaining weight that leads to purging/laxatives/exercise in bulimia).\n\nWhat matters most is whether or not the substance or behavior causes what we now know to be the essence of addiction: uncontrollable, compulsive drug craving, seeking, and use, even in the face of negative health and social consequences.\n\nAddicts are trapped in their behaviors and cannot simply quit on their own. They have an illness that requires biomedical treatment. People often assume that because addiction begins with a voluntary behavior and is expressed in the form of excess behavior, an addict should just be able to quit by force of will alone. However, it is essential to understand when dealing with addicts that we are dealing with individuals whose brains have been altered by alcohol, drug or behavioral abuse. They need addiction treatment.\n\nToday, scientists and physicians overwhelmingly agree that while use and even abuse of drugs such as alcohol and cocaine is a behavior over which the individual exerts control, addiction to these substances is something different. Scientists have begun to understand why addicted people may sacrifice everything that's important to them -- their jobs, their families, their homes -- in the quest for a fix.\n\nBest,\n\n`k.",

I know many people who were diagnosed with them and they were nothing.\n\nHere's some info from webmd:\n\n\nIn particular, they occur in many healthy children, who may or may not outgrow them as adults. They may also occur during pregnancy. Such murmurs are called \"innocent\" heart murmurs. They are not associated with medical or heart conditions, and do not require treatment or lifestyle changes.\n\n\nThough many murmurs are innocent, some may indicate serious heart problems. For instance, heart murmurs may be caused by blood flowing through a heart valve made leaky or narrow by disease. Murmurs can also be caused by increased blood flow across a valve as a result of medical conditions such as anemia or hypothyroidism. Congenital cardiac defects (heart problems present at birth) can also cause heart murmurs. These often can be repaired with surgery.\n\nWithin the heart there are four chambers separated from each other by valves, or flaps, that regulate how much blood enters each chamber at any time. Healthy valves also help prevent blood from flowing in the wrong direction in your heart.\n\nA healthy heart makes a \"lub-dub\" sound as it beats. The \"lub\" (systolic sound) happens when part of the heart contracts and the mitral and tricuspid valves close, and the \"dub\" (diastolic sound) occurs when part of the heart relaxes and the aortic and pulmonic valves close. A heart murmur is an extra sound, such as a whooshing, in the heartbeat caused by irregular blood flow through the heart valves.\n\nHeart murmurs can be heard through a stethoscope and often are detected during routine physical examinations. On further examination, your doctor may find that the heart murmur is innocent. If your heart murmur is related to more serious heart problems, your doctor may refer you to a cardiologist (heart specialist). Medication or surgery may be recommended to treat the underlying problem. He or she may also suggest that you take extra precautions against getting a heart infection, such as by taking antibiotics when you have dental work or some surgeries. With thorough examination and proper tests, your doctor should be able to tell what causes your heart murmur.\n\nSymptoms\nMany people with heart murmurs experience no symptoms. However, some murmurs can occur in conjunction with these other symptoms:\n\n    * Chest pain\n    * Rapid heartbeat (palpitations)\n    * Breathlessness\n    * Fatigue\n    * Bluish skin color or fingertips (sometimes seen in babies with congenital heart defects)",

        "DISCLAIMER: Before using any medicines, you should consult a registered physiscian. This is only for information.\n\nAcne Treatment\n\n|Self-Care at Home|\n\n    * Wash once or twice daily with soap and water to remove excess oil from the skin. An acne cleanser purchased over-the-counter in any drug store can also be helpful. Avoid scrubbing too abrasively because this can actually irritate the skin and cause acne to worsen.\n\n    * Over-the-counter acne medications can be used either at bedtime or during the day. Always follow the directions on any acne product.\n\n    * Many cover-up products are available without a prescription to improve the appearance of blemishes while they have a chance to heal. Most work well and should not worsen acne.\n\n    * Some cosmetics and other skin care products, however, can cause acne to worsen. Look for make-up, cosmetics, and skin care products labeled with the word noncomedogenic. This means that it does not cause or worsen acne.\n\n|Medical Treatment|\n\nMany treatment options are available to treat all forms of acne. Medications are the main treatment for acne and usually work well. Several preparations are available over-the-counter, while others require a prescription from a doctor.\n\n    * Over-the-counter medications: Nonprescription or over-the-counter medications for acne are plentiful and can be effective for milder forms of acne. They come in the form of soaps, washes, and cleansers.\n\n          o Many contain benzoyl peroxide, which does two things. First, benzoyl peroxide kills the acne-causing bacteria, which are thought to play a role in acne. Second, benzoyl peroxide can cause drying and flaking off of skin, which can help prevent the pores from becoming plugged. Plugged pores can develop into acne blemishes.\n\n          o Scrubbing excessively with any over-the-counter preparation can actually cause acne to worsen by additionally irritating the hair follicles.\n\n    * Prescription medications: Doctors can prescribe medications when acne becomes moderate to severe or is not controlled by over-the-counter medications. Prescription drugs can be used effectively alone or in combination with other prescription and nonprescription medications.\n\n          o Antibiotics: Antibiotics can be effective in treating most inflammatory acne (papules and pustules). They work by killing the bacteria and also by decreasing the redness and swelling seen in the inflammatory forms of acne.\n\n                + Antibiotics may be applied to the skin in the form of gels and lotions, or by way of pills. We now know that using a combination of 2 medications together may be very effective in treating acne. Using a topical antibiotic with topical benzoyl peroxide, for example, may prevent bacterial resistance to the antibiotic. Giving an antibiotic by mouth is often needed for acne that is more extensive, red, and tender.\n\n                + Antibiotics taken by mouth can be associated with more side effects than if applied to the skin and may interact with other medicines such as birth control pills. Sensitivity to the sun can result in a \"bad sunburn\" in some people who take the antibiotic tetracycline by mouth.\n\n          o Retinoids: Medicines made from vitamin A (retinoids) are useful in treating several types of acne lesions. Topical retinoids are effective in treating the noninflammatory types of acne (blackheads and whiteheads).\n\n                + Topical retinoids (applied directly to the skin) help to open clogged pores by creating a mild peeling effect. Drying of the skin can be a frequent side effect. Oral retinoids are reserved for treating the more extensive nodular type of acne or severe inflammatory acne, which has not responded to other treatments. Oral retinoids not only have a peeling effect but also decrease the production of oil.\n\n                + They can also be associated with a number of serious side effects including birth defects in babies of wome",

You should get rid of acne at the first sign. Chasing pimples all over your face becomes hectic but its the only way. Some people are allergic to bacteria killing medicine such as benzoyl peroxide and clindamycin. \nTry using these medicines:\n1) Differin Topical Gel\n2) Clearsal Brand Fighter.\n3) Oxy\n4) Proactiv (RISK: Increased Acne)\nRx:\n1) Adoxa (Doxycyline Tablets)\n2) Duac Topical Gel\n\nRemember, allowing more oils and creams/lotions to your face means more blockage and heat to be stored. This causes the over size pimple. Make sure you have some sort of invigorating rubbing cream. St.Ives apricot scrub is the best.\nIf else fails, seek your Physician. An expert germ physician.

The very oldest ones that are dead come off when you scrub or shower. Some are falling off all the time, but they are so small you do not see them.\n\nSince the epidermis consists of rather dry cells, it is able to absorb water.  The cell walls allow the water in your tub, shower, or pool to penetrate into each cell.  The insides, being salty, are have a strong affinity for water.  \n\nIf you spend a long time in the water, the epidermal cells swell up, increasing in size, somewhat like the the balloons mentioned earlier being filled with more water.\n\nWhen the skin on the outside of your hands or toes swells it has more surface area than previously.  Instead of being like a tight fitting glove, it becomes more like a glove that is too big.\n\nIf you put on a glove that is too big, it will have wrinkles instead of being stretched smoothly.\n\nThe entry of water into a cell is called osmosis.  If you stay in fresh water for an extremely long time, many cells will absorb so much water they will burst.  That is called lysis.\n\nRed blood cells are much more fragile than skin cells.  When combined with fresh water they rapidly absorb so much water that they all appear to dissolve.  Each one of the millions and millions of red blood cells has burst.  That is called hemolysis.\n\nRopes made from plant fibers are also composed of cells.  Test a rope:  See if it shrinks in length when absorbing water or drying out.\n\nWhen the skin on your fingers and toes dries out, the cells shrink in size, and the skin becomes more smooth and taut, like a tight, well fitted glove.\n\nYour skin is very important.  Without it you would be just like a raw piece of meat, ready for the flies and germs to eat.\n\nTake good care of your skin.  Do not get sunburned.  When you have a bad cut that is healing, you should try to keep your hands out of dirty water or ponds.\nThese contain potentially dangerous bacteria that could infect your open or healing wound.\n\nTaking a shower or washing your hands in clean water is okay.  Just be sure to put antibiotic ointment and a fresh bandage over the cut when you are done.\n\nYour teacher might be able to show you some pictures of bacteria (germs) or let you look at live ones through a microscope.  \n\nOnly one person is allowed to look through at a time.  Everyone else must stand back and not push the observer or touch their head.  Otherwise you could injure one of their eyes or both by knocking them into the eyepiece or binoculars of the microscope.\n\nSome people have gone blind that way.  No horsing around !!  Strictly enforced.\n\nDuring winter, good skin care means putting lotion on your hands and wearing gloves while outside in the cold winter air.\n\nPeople who drink a carrot milkshake daily, made in a blender, have very beautiful skin once they have done this for six months.\n\nHealthy skin makes both boys and girls look better.",

        "Have you seen a gastroenterologist?  They can do a minimally invasive procedure called an ERCP (Endoscopic Retrograde Cholangiopancreatography - try saying that 3 times fast!).  An ERCP won't get rid of the stones that are in the gallbladder...just the stones that are stuck in the duct leading from the GB to the small intestine.  They can make a tiny cut in the duct and pull gallstones out with a small balloon.  If the stone is too large, they have equipment that will crush the stone so it will pass freely.  \n\nI had the surgery myself about 10 years ago.  It's not as bad as you'd imagine, and you feel much better after it's over.  You might still have phantom pain for a while, but it's nowhere near as bad as the pain you started with.  \n\nEating a diet high in fat will make gallbladder disease worse, but you can't really get rid of the stones unless they pass naturally or you have them removed, either in surgery or with an ERCP.",

Gallstones hurt because when you eat fat, the stomach senses it and tells the gallbladder to release some of the gall into the intestines to help digest the fat.  If you have stones, that squeezing is about like squeezing a handfull of pointy rocks.\n\nHowever...   I've had the surgery and it really isn't a big deal.  There is minimal scarring and the incisions aren't that much bigger than a bug bite or a medium sized zit.  \n\nIf you leave the gallstones there, they can get large enough to damage the gallbladder, with the result of a bad infection and that can cause death, which is a very Bad Thing!",

Now breathe deep (NOT FORCED BREATHING!) and imagine that your lungs are in your neck. Feel for your neck expand with your inhale. On your exhale, feel for the weight of your head and gravity creating more distance between your left ear and your left shoulder. Continue to breathe in this way. If it is too intense, lean less to the right. If not feeling anything. Make sure your neck is relaxed, your elbow is straight and the heel of your left hand is reaching down. Enjoy 5-15 breaths like this. IMPORTANT: when you want to come out of this, slowly shift the weight back to center (KEEP YOUR HEAD HANGING TO THE RIGHT!). Then take your left hand out from under your pelvis. (KEEP YOUR HEAD HANGING TO THE RIGHT!). Then take your right hand on the right side of your head/face; while inhaling, withOUT using your neck muscles, use your right hand/arm to push your head up to center. DO NOT USE YOUR NECK MUSCLES TO BRING YOUIR HEAD BACK UP! Take a few breaths here. Then repeat this on the right side. Hope this helps."

        "Choroidal neovascularization (CNV) is normally associated with macular degeneration. Most of the time, this occurs when new blood vessels grow through cracks in tissue layers beneath the retina called Bruch's membrane. As CNV progresses, the abnormal vessels may leak fluid and bleed.  Eventually this process causes damage to the overlying retina. Decreased and/or distorted vision will often occur. As for the cause in a newborn, I would guess that it would be an inherited eye disease.",
        "I think that you mean CMV, cytomegalovirus. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is a virus related to the herpes virus group of infections. Like herpes, it is inactive at times, but it is incurable and is a life-time infection. CMV may be passed from a mother to her baby during pregnancy and is the most common congenital viral infection. It is also called congenital cytomegalovirus or cytomegalovirus inclusion disease. CMV without symptoms is common in babies and young children. It is found in saliva, urine, semen, and other body fluids. The virus is easily spread in households and in daycare centers. It can be transmitted to the fetus during pregnancy and to the baby during delivery or in breast milk.\n\nOver half of women of childbearing age become infected with CMV at least six months before becoming pregnant. There appear to be few risks for complications of CMV for this group and only a few babies have the infection at birth. These babies appear to have no significant illness or abnormalities.\n\nAbout 90 percent of babies who are infected with CMV have no symptoms at birth. But as many as 15 percent of these babies develop one or more neurological abnormalities \u2014 such as mental retardation, learning disabilities, hearing or vision loss \u2014 usually in the first year or two of life. Congenital CMV infection is a leading cause of hearing loss in children.\n\nAbout one in 1,000 babies (about 4,000 babies each year) shows symptoms of CMV at birth. These symptoms may include an enlarged spleen or liver, jaundice (yellowing of the skin and eyes), and a distinctive rash. Up to 20 percent of these babies die, and about 90 percent of the survivors suffer from serious neurological defects, such as mental retardation.\n\nAt present there is no treatment that can halt or reverse the effects of congenital CMV. However, doctors are investigating whether a new antiviral drug called ganciclovir \u2014 which is used to treat adults with AIDS who have CMV-related eye infections \u2014 also may help babies with congenital CMV."

Use a pH-balanced cleanser without perfumes or too many chemical additives.\n \n2. Touch your face as little as possible, and only when your hands are clean.\n \n3. Avoid squeezing pimples. Bacteria on your hands or on unsterile equipment can lead to more blemishes and possible scarring.\n \n4. Steam your face once or twice a week to help open the pores. Boil water, remove the pot from the stove, drape a towel over your head and hold your face over the pot. Then rinse your face with cold water. \n \n5. Use essential oils such as calendula, chamomile, juniper, lavendar and mint directly on your skin. Mix 10 drops of any of the oils with 2 tbsp. soy or almond oil, and smooth a few drops on dampened skin.\n \n6. Try using herbs. Saw palmetto can help balance boys' hormones, while chaste tree berry can do the same for girls. Echinacea, alfalfa, burdock root, cayenne, chaparral and yellow dock root are also helpful.\n \n7. Consider other topical mixtures. Beat an egg yolk, apply it with a cotton ball and leave it on for 15 minutes. Alternatively, mix oatmeal and honey together to form a paste and apply it to your face. Oatmeal soaks up excess oil and honey soothes the skin.\n \n8. Take acidophilus to fight bacteria.\n \n9. Eat a diet high in fiber, including whole grains and fresh vegetables and fruits, to keep your body healthy overall and provide nutrients to your skin. Stay away from junk food, caffeine and salty foods.\n \n10. Determine whether specific foods aggravate your skin and eliminate them from your diet.\n \n11.

        "Yes, hypnosis can help.  It really depends on the issue being addressed.  Hypnosis is not a magic wand.  Sexual dysfunction is an interesting one because many times the cause is something physical. I have told people to see their doctor first and it turns out that they are diabetic or some other health related issue.  Dysfunction is one of the leading indicators that there are other things going on that need to be checked out.  If every thing is ok and you want a little boost, hypnosis can be great.  Doing it with your partner can be wonderful. Much of hypnosis is about belief and trust.  Making the avenues of communication and trust stronger between partners will always help. \n\nIn the case of inhibition, hypnosis is not mind control.  It can't be use to make you do something that you don't want to do.  It can be used to make you more comfortable with an idea that you chose to explore.  It can be use to help you explore why you are uncomfortable with a subject and if these inhibitions are something you want to modify.  Hypnosis is a tool to get to the solutions that you want arrive at.  Again, it is not a magic wand that will take you there.  You have to do some work.",

If a person has an issue due to who is in control, why would he (or how would he be able to) sit in a chair and allow someone else to reprogram his mind?  \n\nNot everyone can be hypnotized, anyway. Certain people are simply resistant to others tampering with their brains.\n\nI'm not any kind of therapist, but I certainly don't suggest hypnotherapy. People should work out their problems while they are in control of themselves, and take responsibility for their own actions. And suppose the hypnotherapy doesn't work? Is it the hypnotist's fault? No, but some people would use that excuse.\n\nAnd besides, even if the hypnotherapy did work, you're still only putting a band-aid on the issue, because you're only concentrating on the sexual dysfunction. The underlying problem for the sexual dysfunction could be wreaking havoc in other areas of your life, without you being aware.

        "A \"cold\" (runny nose, sinus drainage, sneezing, miserable feeling) is called acute rhinitis.  It's a inflammation of the mucous membranes in the nose and throat and is caused by a virus.   \n\nThere are many viruses that cause head-colds (acute rhinitis) and simply not being warm (no coat, gloves, etc) will not cause you to have acute rhinitis. You must be exposed to the virus before you can \"catch a cold.\" \n\nSneezing causes airborne particles.  Someone who sneezes and has the virus can allow you to get the a cold.  Touching someone or something that has a virus on it can cause you to get a cold (acute rhinitis).\n\nThe virus enters your body by way of your eye, nose, or mouth. \n\nHand-washing is an excellent way to minimize the chance you'll catch a cold.",
        "Both. Yes, you do get colds from airborn or surface viruses. However, your mother is right because being cold will lower your resistance and your immune system.",
        "Research has shown that being \"cold\" does not make you more susceptible to colds. I put cold in quotes because cold is a relative term.  For instance, Mom is cold at 72 degrees and that's just too hot for me.  In the research that has been done, \"cold\" is usually around 40 degrees with their feet in cold water. Even spending quite a bit of time like this, people were still no more likely to catch a cold when directly exposed to cold germs.\n\nAnother reason I point out the relativity of being cold.  This idea has been around a long, long time.  When I read books written in the 1800s, the characters will talk about breaking the ice that had formed on the bedside water pitcher.  These people were sleeping in temperatures far colder than most people in developed countries can even conceive of.\n\nStill, it does seem like people get more colds during winter. It should be noted that this is the same whether you are in Chicago or LA. \n\nIt's possible that germs like it a touch cooler than we do, or it's possible we simply stay inside more, which leads to a greater chance of being exposed to other peoples colds (also, there's a lot more travelling and socializing in November/December - yet more chances to catch a cold).  \n\nIt could be that a good number of cases of colds are just \"cold stress\" - a reaction our bodies have to sudden changes in weather.  I know that my nose will run whenever we get a cold front come through.  \n\nWe have no real data, even on whether there really are more colds in the winter.  So it's hard to tell why we get more colds during the winter.  But getting cold doesn't seem to be that much of a culprit.",
        "When you are cold, your body can't protect itself as well from illness because it turns its attention to protecting you from the cold itself.

Obesity, pregnancy, heavy lifting, and straining to pass stool can cause the intestine to push against the inguinal canal.\n\nSymptoms of inguinal hernia may include a lump in the groin near the thigh; pain in the groin; and, in severe cases, partial or complete blockage of the intestine. The doctor diagnoses hernia by doing a physical exam and by taking x rays and blood tests to check for blockage in the intestine.\n\nThe main treatment for inguinal hernia is surgery to repair the opening in the muscle wall. This surgery is called herniorrhaphy. Sometimes the weak area is reinforced with steel mesh or wire. This operation is called hernioplasty. If the protruding intestine becomes twisted or traps stool, part of the intestine might need to be removed. This surgery is called bowel resection. (Bowel is another word for intestine.)",
        "Its a protrusion of abdominal content frm inguinal canal. It must be treated to prevent further complications. Another hernia is femoral hernia where the content comes frm femoral canal. There are many other uncomman hernia also."

        "From emedicine:  Scleroderma is a systemic disease that affects many organ systems. It is most obvious in the skin; however, the gastrointestinal tract, the respiratory, renal, cardiovascular, and genitourinary systems, as well as numerous vascular structures, are involved frequently. The symptoms result from progressive tissue fibrosis and occlusion of the microvasculature by excessive production and deposition of types I and III collagens. Other macromolecules found in the connective tissue (eg, glycosaminoglycans, tenascin, fibronectin) also are increased. The vascular alterations show a predilection for affecting the small arteries, arterioles, and capillaries. The small vessel cytoskeleton is affected by structural defects that lead to collapse. Next, the tight junctions become altered and are no longer functional, allowing the endothelium to slip into the vessel lumen.\n\nFrom webmd:  Scleroderma (pronounced SKLEER-oh-der-ma) is Greek for hard skin. It's classified as both a connective-tissue disorder and a rheumatic condition. In scleroderma, the skin gradually tightens and thickens or hardens. It loses its ability to stretch. Tiny blood vessels throughout the body also may be affected, causing widespread damage to the internal organs."

The other ones could be green algae and paw paw, etc etc. These medicines are known in the medical field, but they dont talk about it. Because these are natural remedies with no toxic chemicals in it. So, thats why they cant profit from it. If they cant profit, they dont sell. I mean, some are even made of mushrooms that you can grow anywhere. Why would they promote this? These doctors will never make money. So, the FDA has put a restriction on these remedies. They cannot say anything about cancer on their labels. They have to be sold as vitamins or health products. But, the website can tell you how to use it, and what cancers it can cure. See how they are suppressing the world? In fact these treatments can cure up to 90% of patients that doctors have already given up on. Chemo therapy is not a therapy. I would rather die then go through with that. They try to kill your cancer with chemicals and radiation. If they kill all your cancer before they kill all your body cells, then they consider you cured. But, what about after that? Your body is damaged and your health deteriorated. There is almost no recovery to this. How many people you know live past 5 years after chemo therapy? Not much if any at all. And compared to the masses, its almost nothing. What do you have to live with after chemo? Your body is not sunburned, its practically microwaved. CESIUM CHLORIDE can be taken with OXYGEN DROPS. Go to the websites. You can go to these websites and they will give a whole package for you to buy. You can take these medicines over the course of 3 months, a year, or whatever they prescribe. After your mom is feeling well, taking it for about 2 months or more, you can almost garauntee that you are cured. But, you have to listen to them and take it till they tell you to stop. They even cure certain 3rd stage cancers with a 90% success rate. But, time is of the essence so I urge you to buy it as soon as possible and take next day delivery or something. I wish you the best of luck in the future. But, heed my warning, do not go into chemo. They always tell you something fuzzy like, oh..you might live another 2 years, or you might die right away..etc etc....Then how do you decide? But, they always say that people who have been on chemo will only live a maximum of X years after that.

Stop eating at least 3 hours before you get in bed.  A reclining position with food in your stomach irritates the esophogus.  You would be AMAZED at how much this helps.  Soda or alcohol before sleep is the WORST!\n\n3.  Limit intake of:  Alcohol, Caffience, Carbonated beverages, spicy foods, acidic foods, aspirin (or advil, motrin).

Exercise increases your metabolism, burning more calories. It builds muscle which also burns more calories.\nTry to eat small meals several times a day in stead of 3 large meals.

In general, these defects are obvious and include facial bone hypoplasia (under-development), a long, underdeveloped philtrum (the groove in the middle of the upper lip), a thin upper lip, a short nose, and ptosis (drooping of the eyelids). Although the typical facial features may not be as apparent during the newborn period, they become more prominent as the infant develops. As these children grow into young adulthood, however, the facial abnormalities become more subtle and thereby contribute to the difficulty of recognizing FAS in older persons. With these physical abnormalities come sensory deficits that frequently involve vision, hearing and speech. Hyperacusis (abnormal acuteness of hearing) is common in infants, and approximately one third of these infants have a conductive hearing loss and another one-third have a sensorineural hearing loss. More than 90 percent of infants with FAS have delays in receptive and expressive language development.",

        "The aortic valve is the gateway between the left ventricle and the aorta.  This is where fresh oxygenated blood is pumped out to the entire body.  There are a variety of diseases that can require replacement of this valve, including aortic stenosis where the valve does not properly open and close, or an aortic insufficiency where the valve allows backflow of blood from the aorta back into the left ventricle of the heart.\n\nThere are two major types of aortic valve replacements - mechanical valves and biologic/tissue valves.  Mechanical valves have been around longer and subsequently have a very refined safety and efficacy profile.  The downside is that after the procedure, the patient must be put on blood thinners for the rest of their life.  Biologic/tissue valves do not need subsequent blood thinner treatment and therefore may benefit younger, generally healthy patients.  However, it has been shown that the durability of tissue valves may be lower than mechanical valves, which may require a repeat operation later in life.\n\nThere is a variation to the above procedures called the Ross procedure.  This procedure replaces the faulty aortic valve with the patient's own pulmonary valve.  The pulmonary valve is then replaced with a tissue valve.  The rationale for doing this is that more strain is put on the aortic valve and therefore having the person's own anatomy in that place is preferable to having a weaker mechanical or tissue valve.  The pulmonary valve, which only pumps to the lungs (and therefore doesn't have to pump as hard) can withstand having a tissue valve, which isn't as durable.  In addition, this approach does not require blood thinners after the operation.\n\nCurrent cardiac surgery research is trying to investigate if valve replacement can be done in a minimally invasive way using catheter devices.",
        "The aortic valve is a semilunar valve that controls blood flow from the left ventricle to the systemic system of the body.. Its only job is to close so that backflow of blood back to the left ventricle will not be attained.. If the valve is not functioning properly the person's diastolic pressure will increase which will ultimately cause a cardiac infarction. The actual replacement can be achieved, but it is a very delicate surgery because the aorta is the biggest blood vessel in the body. Usually an aortic bypass is performed."

        "Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis\n\nAmyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a neurological disorder characterized by progressive degeneration of motor neuron cells in the spinal cord and brain, which ultimately results in paralysis and death. The disease takes its less-scientific name from Lou Gehrig, a baseball player with the New York Yankees in the late 1920s and 1930s, who was forced to retire in 1939 as a result of the loss of motor control caused by the disease. \n\nIn 1991, a team of researchers linked familial ALS to chromosome 21. Two years later, the SOD1 gene was identified as being associated with many cases of familial ALS. The enzyme coded for by SOD1 carries out a very important function in cells: it removes dangerous superoxide radicals by converting them into non-harmful substances. Defects in the action of this enzyme mean that the superoxide radicals attack cells from the inside, causing their death. Several different mutations in this enzyme all result in ALS, making the exact molecular cause of the disease difficult to ascertain.\n\nRecent research has suggested that treatment with drugs called antioxidants may benefit ALS patients. However, since the molecular genetics of the disease are still unclear, a significant amount of research is still required to design other promising treatments for ALS"

        "hey i read this somewher, that matches the symptons here:\n\nPFIC (Progressive Familial Intrahepatic Cholestasis)\nWhat is Progressive Familial Intrahepatic Cholestasis (PFIC)\n\n\nTaken word for word, it means: Progressive: tending to get worse over time; Familial: passed down to a child from the parents by way of the genes; Intrahepatic: involves disease inside the liver and not the bile ducts outside the liver; Cholestasis: means poor bile flow and build-up of substances in the liver that should be put into bile. \n\n\nThe symptoms of PFIC\n\nFIC1 and BSEP disease cause similar symptoms; together they are called low-GGT PFIC because of a blood test (GGT) that is low rather than high as in most other forms of cholestasis.\n\n These diseases cause cholestasis that begins in early childhood, with the average age at onset being 3 months. However, some patients do not get symptoms of cholestasis until they are teenagers or young adults. These diseases can progress quickly to bad scarring of the liver (cirrhosis) in the first year of life or more slowly with minimal scarring well into the teenage years. Few patients have survived beyond 20 years without treatment. \n\nItching (pruritus) is the main symptom of cholestasis in many patients. Pruritus is often out of proportion to the level of jaundice (yellow eyes or skin), which is often low-grade and can wax and wane. Scratching starts as digging at the ears and eyes, which are the first areas to show bleeding and scarring. The itching may be very disabling and does not usually respond to medications. The scratching interferes with normal activities and sleep and may interfere with learning and schoolwork. \n\nProblems with growth are another major feature of PFIC. Almost all patients are short for their age, but they may not be thin. Delayed puberty and sexual development is common. Patients who are treated can have normal sexual development and several have given birth to normal children. \n\n\nOther common problems include frequent nosebleeds and wheezing. Fat-soluble vitamin (A, E, D and K) deficiencies are common in untreated patients. \n\nVitamin A deficiency can lead to problems with vision. \n\nVitamin E deficiency can lead to problems with balance, strength and coordination. Vitamin D deficiency can lead to poor bone formation. \n\nVitamin K deficiency can lead to bleeding problems. For these reasons, most patients need extra vitamins. Up to a third of patients have gallstones. Most patients have an enlarged liver or enlarged spleen. \n\nAlthough similar, there are differences between patients with BSEP disease and those with FIC1 disease. For example, patients with FIC1 disease are more likely to have watery diarrhea, which can be severe, especially after liver transplantation. However, there is much that we do not yet know about these differences and this will only become clear as more patients are studied.\n\nPatients with PFIC but with high serum GGT have been called PFIC3, and are now called MDR3 disease. These patients have very bad cholestasis in the first year of life, which may progress in the first few years of life toward failure of the liver to do its normal functions. However, there are probably less severe forms of MDR3 disease that cause milder disease. The child and his family may first become aware that there is something wrong during school age or adolescence. Sometimes, problems may not appear until adulthood. The full spectrum of liver problems caused by MDR3 disease is just now becoming known."

        "I would recommend Louise Hay's \"Self-Esteem Affirmations\" on CD. You can listen to it over and over again and the positive messages get into your subconscious. I also recommend \"Feel the Fear and Do It Anyway\" by Susan Jeffers. It teaches you to repeat \"I'll Handle It\", which is very helpful during a panic attack.\n\nI have suffered from panic attacks for over 3 years and the above suggestions are the only thing that have helped me.",

        "Panic attacks are extremely frightening and often very disabling. Suggested methods for overcoming them depend on vairous factors including - how frequent the attacks are, what disruption they cause in your life and whether they are associated with any particular situation. If your panic attacks are repititive and frequent you may have consulted a mental health professional. Psychological therapies and medication are the two main methods used. Psychological therapies like relaxation training and Exposure and response prevention aim at recognition and working through a panic attack, so that they eventually decrease in frequency. Medication is used if psychological therapies do not work, if the attacks are very  severe or in conjunction with psychological treatment. Common ones have included antidepressants such as Fluoxetine, venlafaxine etc. I would steer clear of benzos as they may be habit forming and one quickly gets habituated to their actions.\n\nIn the end the best person to contact may be your psychiatrist or psychologist. I have no knowledge of any other methods though they exist and information is available on the web.",
        "I have had panic attacks also. I would highly recommend trying several natural strategies before doing any prescription medication. There is a great book called \"Natural Relief for Anxiety: Complementary Strategies for Easing Fear, Panic & Worry\" that outlines various strategies.\n\nFirst, one of the most immediate things you can do is to cut out caffeine, alcohol, cigarettes and any drugs. These things obviously disrupt any physical and mental balances.\n\nSecond, exercise exercise exercise. There is a lot of scientific data that says *vigorous* exercise can really be the most effective way to clean up your head and also strengthen your heart. Regular exercise (I recommend swimming as the most effective) will definitely strengthen your heart, put your blood pressure at normal levels and reduce any sensations of heart palpitations that are associated with panic attacks.\n\nThird, take at least 2 hours per day to relax/meditate. I would recommend a combination of yoga, a soak in a hot bath or hot tub and a nap in quiet room with nothing but candles, very soft relaxing music. Turn off the phone, turn off the lights, lock the doors, just relax, breath, meditate. If you can afford massage, I think that is a way to complement this relaxation time.\n\nFourth, when you actually have a panic attack, try this very simple strategy. First say to yourself over and over \"Everything is fine, it's just a panic attack. People have them everyday. It's uncomfortable but it will pass very soon.\" As you repeat this to yourself, breathe in very deeply and very slowly ... breath in for 4-5 seconds, hold for 4-5 seconds and release for 4-5 seconds. Do this sequence 20 times in a row. It will quickly reduce your heart rate and increase oxygen flow to your brain which in turns increases your rationality, thereby reducing your irrationality (the panic).\n\nFifth, read the book I recommend. There are some special diet stratgies, possible food allergies that could be involved and vitamin/mineral supplements that can help you.\n\nSixth, find a therapist that specializes in anxiety/panic disorders. You will need to find out what is the root cause of your panic ... that is, what exactly are you so afraid of? \n\nPeople do conquer panic attacks. You can do it!!"

Gee, can I ask what exactly you are depressed about?\n\nSo, my point is that you can only be helped if you're willing to let others help you. This of course means taking advice from someone in a professional enough position to comment on your condition (e.g. how bad it is). Sure, you may need medication or you may not. Why do you refuse to take drugs anyway? You know eventually you may not even have a choice in taking some. Have you thought about that?\n\nOverall, my opinion is that I think the first thing you need to do is forget about 5 minute solutions. Depression doesn't work like that.

        "Well, it's basically an inflammation.  Anti-inflammatories like ibuprofen can be an enormous help.  Unfortunately, oral administration distributes the drug to the whole body, and the place where you need it can be under-treated.  Plus, ibuprofen and aspirin can cause stomach problems if you start raising the dosage.  \n\nThere is a solution- topical administration.  Ask your doctor for a prescription for ibuprofen cream.  It is usually called something else, like ketoprofen, and can be made with a topical pain-reliever such as bupivicane (like lidocaine).  Keep in mind your doctor may not have heard of it, and that it has to be compounded.  Check your phonebook for local compounding pharmacies so that you can give your doctor their phone number. Typically the cream comes as 10-20% active, which is possible because it will never be in your stomach to cause problems.  Unfortunately, because it has to be compounded, your insurance company will probably not cover it in the same way as regular drugs.  You may be looking at paying $50 for a 4oz jar. \n\nWhen you apply- be sure to really rub and massage the cream into your hands hard for 5-10 minutes.  This will help just as much as the ibuprofen will, because the muscle work will greatly increase blood flow to the area.  Together, massage and anti-inflammatory therapy can provide great relief.\n\nResults vary with patient.  I hope you find it useful.",

This helps prevent breakouts. \n\nThere are five steps to basic skin care not including the acne treatment gel I would have you try. \n\n1. Cleanse\n2. Exfoliate\n3. Tone/Freshen\n4. Moisturize\n5. Protect\n\nThe Mary Kay 3 in 1 cleanser can do the first three steps in one. The fifth step is protect. You want to use an oil free foundation. When your skin is protected with foundation you can wash off the impurities that your skin catches in the air. The foundation catches the irritants and impurities instead of them getting into your pores causing further breakouts. Mary Kay is satasfaction guaranteed. So if you try it and it doesnt work for you you can get different products or your money back. \n\nAlso it is so important that when you are using skin care you use one line be it Mary Kay or Avon or a Walmart brand. They are formulated to work with one another. Mixing products not designed to work together can cause reactions in some people. ;) Hope this was helpful!!\n\nMeganHill@MaryKay.com if you need anything else\nwww.MaryKay.com/MeganHill to check out the line\n\nMegan",

        "You need to target exercises on your abdominal muscles.",
        "In order to be succeed at thinning your waistline, you have to get a basic under standing of how the abdominal muscles function and how your body burns fat.\n\nThe first thing that you need to understand is the difference between fat and muscle tissue. Fat is created by eating excess calories and it is primarily stored in layers on top of your muscles. Muscle tissue consists of fibers that contract to produce movement.\n\nFat can't turn into muscle, and muscle can't turn into fat. But you can lose muscle mass while you gain fat. That's what happens to most people, especially as they begin to get a little older.\n\nSo if your goal is a trim waist line and a nice flat stomach, the first thing you need to do is remove the layers of fat that are sitting on top of your abs. Everyone has a flat stomach. It's just that some of them are covered with excess fat. \n\nThe most effective way to flatten your stomach is with a combination of strength training (placing an extra focus on the mid-section), cardiovascular exercises (short, intensive workouts), and a stable blood sugar level to keep you from adding even more fat (and it makes it easier for the body to use your body fat for fuel). \nYou have to do some type of progressive strength training. The ab muscle is primarily used to flex your torso forward. But there are also muscles that flex your torso to the side and other muscles that rotate it. Often you will see people on their ab roller every day doing lots of sit-ups or crunches. \n\nIf you want to effectively strengthen your stomach muscles you need to incorporate these exercises: \n  \n1-2 forward flexion exercises (sit-up, crunch, etc.) \n  \n1-2 side flexion exercises (side crunches, side bends, etc.) \n  \n1-2 rotational exercises (standing twists, trunk rotations, etc.)\n  \nYour abs are muscles, and just like any other muscles, they should be exercised at most 3 times per week. You also want to make sure you're training them progressively, which means working them harder each time. \n  \nIncrease metabolism using short, and hard, cardio workouts. Cardio workouts are very important because they can, if done properly, increase your metabolism for up to 24 hours or more!\n\nThis means that you're less likely to store any excess calories as body fat simply because they're more likely to be used up by your higher metabolism. Plus, you're more likely to burn off some excess body fat in the process! \n\nHere's a simple interval workout that you can do with just about any activity (bicycling, walking, swimming, etc).\n  \nWarm up at an easy pace for 2-5 minutes \n  \nPerform 30 seconds of hard exercise (almost as hard as possible) \n  \nperform one minute of moderate exercise (recovery time to catch your breath) \n  \nRepeat this process from 6-10 times \n  \nCool down at an easy pace for 2-5 minutes  \n  \nMaintaining a stable blood sugar level is the key. Most importantly, you have to stabilize your blood sugar level! This is by far the most important factor when it comes to shedding that excess body fat and keeping it off!\n\nTo stabilize your blood sugar level you have to feed your body frequently, about every 2-3 hours. The key is to give your body only the amount of food that it needs at that time. Your body burns calories all day long, so why would you only feed it once or twice a day?\n\nGive your body the fuel it needs: fruits, whole grains, vegetables, nuts, berries, and lean proteins (fish, lean beef, chicken, eggs, etc). \n\nMost people pay too much attention to how much fat is in food, or how healthy a meal is. Calories are calories. It doesn\u2019t matter where they come from. If there\u2019s extra it's going to body fat! \n\nI'm not saying that what you eat isn't important because it is. It just doesn\u2019t have all that much of an affect when it comes to losing fat. Make healthy choices whenever possible, but don\u2019t feel like every cheeseburger you eat is guaranteed to be st"

These symptoms may leave them fearful and withdrawn. Their speech and behavior can be so disorganized that they may be incomprehensible or frightening to others.

I'll tell you what I told her. Finish high school. Then take some college courses. Get a job. In between times, surround yourself with a healthy circle of friends...ones that aren't after you for money, a place to sleep, or smokes. Find other young mom's who are doing the same thing. Find a MOPS group...Mother's Of Pre-schoolers. It's a mother's group, who meet regularly (weekly) and get together with their children, sharing tips, recipes, cleaning ideas, and each others problems. Once a month, they hire a babysitter and do something together, like go to a movie, bowling or a number of other fun, wholesome activities. Getting involved with a volunteer organization will get you out of the house and helping others with bigger needs than yours. If your child is old enough (as young as 3), you can enroll them in Headstart. There are lots of activities for the parent to get involved with there, along with being with other parents who are going through some of the same things. Some people will find an grandmother-type person, who is still very active, and you help each other. She can help you with your child, being a surrogate grandma, and she can teach you what she knows. You can help her with some of the chores that are maybe a little difficult for her. The thing is to do something with your life that's meaningful to you and your child. When you get involved, you teach yourself and you teach your child, and you'll end up showing your child how to give of himself to those less fortunate. <*)))><",

        "Constipation, infrequent or irregular bowel movements, is no fun for anyone. It can be painful and uncomfortable. Constipation can be attributed to at least one of several factors: poor eating habits, lack of exercise, not eating enough fiber or drinking enough fluids, and even possibly serious illness.\n\nFortunately, there are things one can do to prevent constipation.\n\nSince dehydration can lead to constipation, one should always drink at least eight eight-ounce glasses of water each day. It\u2019s best to avoid caffeine since it causes dehydration and can act as a diuretic. Those who do enjoy caffeinated beverages on a regular basis should do so in moderation.\n\nA healthy diet is key for preventing constipation. A high fiber diet rich in fruits, vegetables, beans and nuts ensures regularity. Consuming an apple every day, with its skin intact, is another sure way to prevent constipation. Guava is another helpful fruit, but it should be eaten with its seeds to ensure the full effect. Starchy foods should be avoided when one is constipated as this will only escalate the problem.\n\nRegular exercise will also assist in one\u2019s quest for regularity. Even if it\u2019s a daily stroll in the park, exercise is important.\n\nIf you\u2019re feeling a little backed up, perhaps one or some of these remedies can help.\n\nLaxatives \u2013 There are many over the counter products to choose from in price ranges and formulas to suit everyone\u2019s personal preference. If you\u2019re not sure which product is right for you, check with your pharmacist or physician. Either is sure to recommend the product that is right for you. \nLemon and Honey \u2013 Mix two tablespoons of lemon juice and one teaspoon of honey into a glass of warm water. Drink one glass in the morning and one in the evening to bring back regularity. \nOrange Juice and Olive Oil \u2013 Drink a glass or mug filled with half each of orange juice and olive oil. It may not taste great but it will have your plumbing running smoothly in no time. \nLicorice \u2013 Licorice has laxative qualities. Eating several pieces of real licorice will help to relieve your constipation. \nGrapes \u2013 A large bunch of grapes should do the trick. \nCastor oil and honey \u2013 Honey seems to appear in many remedies for constipation. In addition to taking it with lemon and even by itself, one can also mix one teaspoon of honey with one teaspoon of castor oil. \nSomething else a person who is suffering from constipation can try is a cup of tomato juice mixed with half a cup of sauerkraut juice and a quarter cup of carrot juice. It may not have a pleasant flavor, but it works great!\nWhen it comes to constipation, the important thing is to have a proper diet, drink water often throughout the day, and exercise on a regular basis. If your constipation lasts for longer than a week, contact your physician. In the meantime, why not try one of the above remedies?",

It can even help trigger dandruff or exacerbate existing symptoms. \nShampoo often. If you tend to have an oily scalp, daily shampooing to remove the excess oil may help prevent dandruff. \nCut back on styling products. Hair sprays, styling gels, mousses and hair waxes can all build up on your hair and scalp, making them oilier. Some people may even develop allergies to various hair-care products. \nEat a healthy diet. For overall good health, include plenty of fresh fruits and vegetables, whole grains, and small amounts of lean protein in your diet. \nGet a little sun. Sunlight may be good for dandruff.

        "There are three types of tea Black, Oolong, and Green tea. \n\nThe difference between the Green tea and the others is that green tea is not fermented, thus keeping in the powerful antioxidants lost in the fermenting process. \n\nGreen tea also contains polyphenols such as tannins (a nutrient antioxidant) catchins (EGCG which is a powerful antioxidant), and flavenoids, as well as other vitamins and minerals, such as Vitamin C. The antioxidants help your body fight against free radicals, which can mutate cells and make you sick. \n\nNumerous scientific discoveries have also linked green tea with remarkable disease preventative properties. Gargling with green tea has been shown to inactivate the flu virus, as has drinking a cup each day to activate the polyphenols (powerful antioxidants) that are also suspected to work well against both the cold and flu viri. \n\nAs China permits greater access to its interior to scientists, reports grow of entire villages in the green tea growing regions where cancers and sicknesses are statistically lower than the national norm. Though such studies are best classified as emergent, green tea is becoming widely viewed as one of the superfoods of the future. \n\n\nHere are just a few known health benefits of drinking green tea: \n\n\nBoosts your immune system \nLowers blood sugar \nHelps prevent cavities and tooth decay \nSlows the aging process \nHelps reduce the risk of cancer \nLowers cholesterol \nAids in weight loss by burning calories \nReduces high blood pressure \nPrevents arthritis \nReduces the risk of heart disease \nReduces the risk of stroke \nLowers the risk of blood clot \n\n\nAnti-Cancer Compound In Green Tea Identified Researchers at the University of Murcia in Spain (UMU) and the John Innes Center (JIC) in Norwich, England have shown that a compound called EGCG in green tea prevents cancer cells from growing by binding to a specific enzyme. \"We have shown for the first time that EGCG, which is present in green tea at relatively high concentrations, inhibits the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), which is a recognized, established target for anti-cancer drugs, \" Professor Roger Thorneley, of JIC, told Reuters. \n\n\nIt does \"Aid in weight loss by burning calories\"\n\nPopular brands include Tazo, Stash, Bigelow and Pacific Chai. \n\nYou can buy it here:\nhttp://www.green-tea-benefits.com/shopping.html"

        "There are several types of leukemia. They are grouped in two ways. One way is by how quickly the disease develops and gets worse. The other way is by the type of blood cell that is affected.\n\nLeukemia is either acute or chronic. In acute leukemia, the abnormal blood cells are blasts that remain very immature and cannot carry out their normal functions. The number of blasts increases rapidly, and the disease becomes worse quickly. In chronic leukemia, some blast cells are present, but in general, these cells are more mature and can carry out some of their normal functions. Also, the number of blasts increases less rapidly than in acute leukemia. As a result, chronic leukemia worsens gradually.\n\nLeukemia can arise in either of the two main types of white blood cells: lymphoid cells or myeloid cells. When leukemia affects lymphoid cells, it is called lymphocytic leukemia. When myeloid cells are affected, the disease is called myeloid or myelogenous leukemia.\n\nThese are the most common types of leukemia:\n\n1.Acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) is the most common type of leukemia in young children. This disease also affects adults, especially those age 65 and older. \n2.Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) occurs in both adults and children. This type of leukemia is sometimes called acute nonlymphocytic leukemia (ANLL). \n3.Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) most often affects adults over the age of 55. It sometimes occurs in younger adults, but it almost never affects children. \n4.Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) occurs mainly in adults. A very small number of children also develop this disease. \n5.Hairy cell leukemia is an uncommon type of chronic leukemia. This and other uncommon types of leukemia are not discussed here. The Cancer Information Service can supply information about them.",

        "Overview & Considerations\n\nFatigue is different from drowsiness. In general, drowsiness is feeling the need to sleep, while fatigue is a lack of energy and motivation. Drowsiness and apathy (a feeling of indifference or not caring about what happens) can be symptoms of fatigue.\n\nFatigue can be a normal and important response to physical exertion, emotional stress, boredom, or lack of sleep. However, it can also be a nonspecific sign of a more serious psychological or physical disorder. Fatigue that is not relieved by enough sleep, good nutrition, or a low-stress environment should be evaluated by your doctor. Because fatigue is a common complaint, sometimes a potentially serious cause may be overlooked.\n\nThe pattern of fatigue may help your doctor determine its underlying cause. For example, if you wake up in the morning rested but rapidly develop fatigue with activity, you may have an ongoing physical condition like an underactive thyroid. On the other hand, if you wake up with a low level of energy and have fatigue that lasts throughout the day, you may be depressed.\n========================\n\nDo you have any underlying illnesses? Is your thyroid funcioning correctly? Are you sleeping soundly? Each of these can lead to fatigue. Have your doctor do some tests for thyroid function and ask your mate if you snore, if so, have a sleep study done. If you have an illness, don't take the vitamins without your doctor knowing what you are taking. (For instance, Warafin+Vit.K= trouble.)\n\nYour work place can be making you sick too. Check the info on the webmd link below to see if that is the problem. \n\nThere are so many reasons to be tired its hard to answer your question. The best way I think is to say what is \"not\" causing the lethargy and you will be led to what is causing it.\n\nGood Luck~\n\nGood Luck.",

While testicular cancer is common among young men, young men typically do not develop any kind of cancer, so overall, testicular cancer is a relatively rare disease. This form of cancer is almost always curable if it is found early.

Children born with an undescended testicle have an increased risk of getting testicular cancer, regardless of whether surgery is done to correct the problem.

        "Dyslexia is a neurological disorder with biochemical and genetic markers. In its most common and apparent form, it is a disability in which a person's reading and/or writing ability is significantly lower than that which would be predicted by his or her general level of intelligence. However, as has been discovered only in the last decade, individuals may read and write perfectly and still have dyslexia (see \"characteristics\" below).\n\nThe term was coined in 1887. People are diagnosed as dyslexic when their reading problems cannot be explained by a lack of intellectual ability, inadequate instruction, or sensory problems such as poor eyesight.

        "It is a infectious disease-mostly kids get--with a rash on feet, hands and mouth--it goes away in about 14 days--no big deal",
        "What is \"fifth disease?\"\n\nFifth disease is a mild rash illness that occurs most commonly in children. The ill child typically has a \"slapped-cheek\" rash on the face and a lacy red rash on the trunk and limbs. Occasionally, the rash may itch. An ill child may have a low-grade fever, malaise, or a \"cold\" a few days before the rash breaks out. The child is usually not very ill, and the rash resolves in 7 to 10 days.\n\nWhat causes fifth disease?\n\nFifth disease is caused by infection with human parvovirus B19. This virus infects only humans. Pet dogs or cats may be immunized against \"parvovirus,\" but these are animal parvoviruses that do not infect humans. Therefore, a child cannot \"catch\" parvovirus from a pet dog or cat, and a pet cat or dog cannot catch human parvovirus B19 from an ill child.\n\nCan adults get fifth disease?\n\nYes, they can. An adult who is not immune can be infected with parvovirus B19 and either have no symptoms or develop the typical rash of fifth disease, joint pain or swelling, or both. Usually, joints on both sides of the body are affected. The joints most frequently affected are the hands, wrists, and knees. The joint pain and swelling usually resolve in a week or two, but they may last several months. About 50% of adults, however, have been previously infected with parvovirus B19, have developed immunity to the virus, and cannot get fifth disease.\n\nIs fifth disease contagious?\n\nYes. A person infected with parvovirus B19 is contagious during the early part of the illness, before the rash appears. By the time a child has the characteristic \"slapped cheek\" rash of fifth disease, for example, he or she is probably no longer contagious and may return to school or child care center. This contagious period is different than that for many other rash illnesses, such as measles, for which the child is contagious while he or she has the rash.\n\nHow does someone get infected with parvovirus B19?\n\nParvovirus B19 has been found in the respiratory secretions (e.g., saliva, sputum, or nasal mucus) of infected persons before the onset of rash, when they appear to \"just have a cold.\" The virus is probably spread from person to person by direct contact with those secretions, such as sharing drinking cups or utensils. In a household, as many as 50% of susceptible persons exposed to a family member who has fifth disease may become infected. During school outbreaks, 10% to 60% of students may get fifth disease.\n\nHow soon after infection with parvovirus B19 does a person become ill?\n\nA susceptible person usually becomes ill 4 to 14 days after being infected with the virus, but may become ill for as long as 20 days after infection.\n\nDoes everyone who is infected with parvovirus B19 become ill?\n\nNo. During outbreaks of fifth disease, about 20% of adults and children who are infected with parvovirus B19 do not develop any symptoms. Furthermore, other persons infected with the virus will have a non-specific illness that is not characteristic of fifth disease. Persons infected with the virus, however, do develop lasting immunity that protects them against infection in the future.\n\nHow is fifth disease diagnosed?\n\nA physician can often diagnose fifth disease by seeing the typical rash during a physical examination. In cases in which it is important to confirm the diagnosis, a blood test may be done to look for antibodies to parvovirus. Antibodies are proteins produced by the immune system in response to parvovirus B19 and other germs. If immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibody to parvovirus B19 is detected, the test result suggests that the person has had a recent infection.\n\nIs fifth disease serious?\n\nFifth disease is usually a mild illness that resolves on its own among children and adults who are otherwise healthy. Joint pain and swelling in adults usually resolve without long-term disability.\n\nParvovirus B19 infection may cause a serious"

        "It is spelled Reiki and pertains to the use of energy to heal the body.\n\n\"Reiki is a form of Japanese spiritual healing.  This complementary medicine has its foundation in ancient Tibetan Buddhism, apparently forgotten until its rediscovery in the late 19th century.  The aim of reiki is to promote health, maintain well-being, and help people attain a higher consciousness.  Practitioners draw on \"reiki energy\" channeling it to areas of need in themselves and their patients.  They borrow terminology from physics, claiming that reiki acts at an atomic level, causing the body's molecules to vibrate with higher intensity and thus dissolving energy blockages that lead to disharmony and disease.  \n\nA treatment session lasts about an hour; the practitioner directs reike energy through his hands to the patient.  The patient lies clothed on a treatment table and the practitioner holds his hands on or over the body in 12 basic positions for about five minutes each.  This is said to balance the body's energy centers or \"chakras.\"  Some patients may feel relaxed after treatment; others feel invigorated.\"\n\nTo get in touch with your own energy body as a beginner, I recommend T'ai Chi. You can find classes at the YMCA or, sometimes, through the  adult education programs in American cities.",

This is the best book available for depression.\n\nTry to get therapy if you can.  If you can't afford it, there may be resources available to help you.

        "The answer is \"yeh you are being affected adversely\"\n\nIt may take time to build into a heart or lung condition - but it probably will do that. \n\nI assume you are an early smoker, with that, you are building a dependence that will make it very difficult to let go of the habit, even when you want to.  I've seen people already diagnosed with heart or lung disease who continued to smoke because the addiction was too strong for them to break.  \n\nNot only are you damaging cells inside your body, but you are damaging your skin.  The most wrinkled people are the ones who have smoked over the years.  You can see  how the smoke constantly building would affect the skin.  Wrinkles around the lips and in the soft tissue under the eyes are the most prevalent in smokers.  Smoking takes the vitamins right out of your body, and can cause the bones and teeth to become weaker.\n\nSo, now you see you are damaging your heart & your lungs. Your respiratory system cancels out your breathing.  Cancer is prevalent in throat, tongue, lips, your bones and teeth are unhealthy - and finally, it's gotten to your skin too. \n\nIf that doesn't make you stop - Let me remind you that you are also damaging anyone who happens to be in the room with you while you are smoking.  Second hand smoke has been proven to be as damaging as first hand.\n\nQuit smoking and people will want to be with you more often.  Not only that you will smell better, breathe better and certainly like yourself better.\n\nPlus you will save a lot of money as another side benefit.\n\nGood luck.  Hope you'll give it your best shot.  Never quit quitting.",

        "Well, situps are a waste of time.  Some people do like as much sit ups as they can to achieve that 6 pack.  And to be honest, some never get it.  Its cuz the muscles arent big enough to show a 6 pack.  There was never enough resistance to get it.  I dont recommend any type of sit ups.  I do a kung fu style push up that gives you the best results.  Imagine, everybody can do like 10 or 20, maybe 100 sit ups, but with this, some cannot even do one.  But, just because you cant do one doesnt mean you havent done any work.  Eventually, after trying every day, you will be able to do one.  And then 2, 3, and slowly you work your way to like 25.  You only need to do about 15 to 20 per day to keep that 6 pack after its there.  You lay flat on the floor on your stomach.  Then you prop your feet up in push up position.  Now you put your hands out there on the floor.  Now put them together so that they are just touching.  Now, try to do a push up.  Keep your back as straight as possible.  When you first do this, your back will have a tendency to bend because you are trying to do at least one.  Hehe.  Um, I used to be able to do 50 of these easy.  After I get it, it was a cinch.  It will take you like 1 to 2 minutes a day trying to do like 20.  Thats all it takes to keep your 6 pack.  I used to do crunches.  Elbows to knees.  They arent bad, but this is far better.  Because doing crunches, you might not be able to sit on the floor with your legs out, and lift your body with your two hands without touching the floor.  With these push ups, after you get the hang of it, you can lift yourself off the ground, with your legs parallel to the ground.  This is when you know that you are on your way.  Its the fastest, the best, and the only one that pin points right at your stomach.  Good luck.  Once there, you will need to work a difference excercise for that 8 pack.  People dont say 8 because they dont believe it exists.  It does, and I have it.  I will assist further when you are ready.  Just make sure you rate me hehee...",

        "working out anything past 45 min is a waste of time because you end up destroy your own current muscles for energy, and also leads to overtraining which will also waste your muscle and prevent them from recovering thus will not build you any new muscle. So working out 24 hours a day as stated above is pure stupidity.\n\nalso 3X 20 sets is another stupid answer which will lead to what i already stated above.\n\n\nnow here is the way to build muscle properly and increase the speed in which you will gain them:\n\nthe secret to gaining muscle is to shock your muscles every work out. this can be done in the following ways:\n\n-changing the order of the exercise each work out\n- changing the speed at which you lift the weights, slow or faster\n-super sets which means doing two or more opposite or same body part exercises\n- giant sets which means no rest between all sets performed for a specific body part\n- negatives which means lowering the weight very slowly after one rep\n- stripping which means lifting the heaviest weight you can to muscle failure (when you can lift it anymore) for no more than 6-8 repetitions and then going to a slightly lower weight + repeat\n\nthat's only a few ways to shock your muscles into growing. Muscles have a memory so you must vary and change your routine and shocking methods constantly.\n\nalso there is the diet component:\n\nproteins: make sure you eat a palm size protein portion every meal, which should be every 3 hours that you arent sleeping and do not eatt 3 hours before going to bed to prevent food from metabolizing into fat.\n\ncarbs: 2 clenched fists is the ideal portion\n\nfats: olive oils, flaxseed oils, peanuts, almonds, no more than 10-12 or a table spoon per meal for the oils\n\nmake sure you do not work the same muscle groups within 48 hours or 2 days to give them time to recover and grow.\n\nmake sure you sleep at least 8 hours, as much of the recovery occurs during sleep.\n\nmake sure you eat no more than 1 hour after your work outs\n\nmake sure you have a protein shake before going to bed, no other food if possible \n\nthrow junk food, alcohol, and other tempting food in the garbage. \n\nkeep your training to 3 sets of 6-8 repetitions per exercise@ 3 exercises per body part\n\nany more question, visit this excellent site bellow, and good luck",

Gynaecological examination is special in that it is quite intimate, and that it involves special equipment -- the speculum. The speculum consists of two hinged blades of flat metal, which are used to open the vagina, to permit examination of the cervix uteri. Gynaecologists may also do a bimanual examination (one hand on the abdomen, two fingers in the vagina), to palpate the uterus and ovaries. They may occasionally do a rectal exam. Male gynaecologists often have a female chaperone (nurse or medical student) for their examination. Virgins are not usually examined vaginally. An abdominal ultrasound is used normally to confirm the bimanual examination.\n\n\n\n\n\nInvestigations\nSome of the investigations used in gynaecology are:\n\nabdominal ultrasound, to give a low-power view of the pelvic organs. \nvaginal ultrasound. A probe is passed into the vagina, which allows a detailed view of the uterus and its contents. \nblood tests. Levels of hormones such as estradiol, luteinizing hormone, follicle stimulating hormone and progesterone are measured, as well as prolactin. \nhysteroscopy -- a fine tube is passed into the uterus via the cervix under a general anaesthetic. \nlaparoscopy -- tubes are passed into the peritoneal cavity, which is then insufflated with carbon dioxide. This is commonly used to diagnose endometriosis. \nMRI and CT scans are rarely used, apart from tumor staging in gynecological cancer. Pelvic X-ray is rare. It can be used to delineate the uterine cavity with an injected dye (hysterosalpingogram) and to measure the pelvic girdle.\n\n\nDiseases\nThe main conditions dealt with by a gynaecologist are:\n\ncancer of the cervix. The Papanicolaou (Pap) smear is a means of detecting this, by obtaining a sample of cervical epithelial cells and examining them under a microscope for malignant changes. All women are encouraged to have pap smears at regular intervals after commencing intercourse. \nincontinence of urine. \namenorrhoea (absent periods) \ndysmenorrhoea (painful periods) \ninfertility \nmenorrhagia (heavy periods). This is a main indication for hysterectomy. \nprolapse \nObviously there is some crossover in these areas.

This is why BMI for children, also referred to as BMI-for-age, is gender and age specific.1, 2 BMI-for-age is plotted on gender specific growth charts. These charts are used for children and teens 2 \u2013 20 years of age. For the 2000 CDC Growth Charts and Additional Information visit CDC's National Center for Health Statistics.\n\nEach of the CDC BMI-for-age gender specific charts contains a series of curved lines indicating specific percentiles.

And then there's genetics. If there are a lot of heavier people in her family then chances are she's gonna be heavier too no matter what she does. And then her metabolism also plays a factor. If her metabolism is slow then she's just gonna be heavier. But if she's only 5 feet tall then hopefully she's not TOO heavy. Because that could cause heart problems for her.

I was in very serious trouble for 9 years, until 1998. I work in big place and finally I started getting some answers.\nThis is what I did, I am in better control:\n- I started using Gymnema sylvestre, I take around 10 tablets everyday. It must be taken with meals, since it works on food. Started with one tablet with each meal. You have learn to use it. It will take some time. I tried different brands, the one which I liked is from PURITAN PRIDE (THEY ARE ON THE INTERNET).\n- During 9 years my sugar used to be more than 350 all the time. Because I was eating very healthy (I thought so), i.e. mostly whole wheat, and other whole grains.\nFinally I stopped whole wheat, after 7 days my blood sugar dropped to around 180. I am type 2. Gymnema Sylvestre I started about 1 1/2 years after that. Now instead of whole wheat I eat white flower and boiled chicken, lentils, etc.\n- I was tired of people giving me all kind of suggestions, so I decided to do some work myself. For about couple of weeks I tested my sugar(around 40 times) before and after eating different foods. It gave me most of the facts.  By the way I found sugar from whole wheat sits in your body for 6 to 14 days. \n- I also learned acidic foods raise blood sugar weight etc.It happens because overacidity is like meat tenderizer. Tissue damage in the stomach does not allow you to digest food properly. Also agressive exercise can also damage stomach tissues, leading to excessive weight. Try avoiding just for couple of weeks see what you find? \n- Presently I am taking Glyburide, Actos, and Lentus\n(insulin replacement shots)\nMy recommendation is search google for gymnema sylvestre, and overacidity. also do not trust anybody including you, verify everything, if you can.\nGood luck. No one know how it feels like to be a diabetic except you. I hope this information could help you.",

        "Bird Flu \nHundreds of thousands of birds in Asia died due to a virus that has been dubbed the \"bird flu.\" The highly contagious illness is responsible for wiping out large numbers of poultry in Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Vietnam. The particular strain of influenza which has been reported as causing the deaths is called H5N1. Humans can contract the disease through close contact with infected birds, or with the feces of infected birds. It is not known to spread through human-to-human contact. There has been no indication that humans would get the disease through eating eggs or meat of sick birds.\n\nThe only known way to eradicate the disease is by culling infected flocks. Thus far millions of chickens, ducks and other kinds of poultry have been culled in an effort to eliminate the virus. There have been several deaths due to the flu and the World Health Organization has expressed concern that the virus could latch on to a human influenza virus, potentially causing a serious epidemic. The bird flu's symptoms in humans include fever and coughing and eventual pneumonia."

Your dentist would measure this with a probe.\n\nIf your pockets are deeper than 4 mm then it means that you have had bone loss  which is usually caused by periodontal disease (an infection in the gums). The best way to prevent periodontal problems is to brush and FLOSS your teeth regularly (brush at least twice a day for two minutes). \n\nI emphasize flossing, because often people don't realize just how important it is. The contact between the two teeth are where food are most likely to get stuck, and therefore where bacteria sticks most often, too. The purpose of flossing is to really clean that surface where two teeth touch. So instead of focusing on just making the floss go down between the teeth, you want to follow the sides of your teeth to make sure you remove the plaque.

I was given antibiotics (pills) and after the meds were gone, so was the ear infection and the spinning room.",

        "You have several options to treat your Vertigo. Because Vertigo is not a disease, Vertigo treatment and Vertigo remedies depend upon diagnosing the underlying cause. Once the cause is identified, doctors may choose from among these Vertigo treatment options:\n\nVestibular Rehabilitation Therapy\n    Vestibular rehabilitation therapy (VRT) is a physical therapy-based Vertigo treatment. It is designed to reduce the effects of Vertigo symptoms by introducing the patient to a series of exercises for Vertigo. Successful Vertigo treatment using this method is said to improve balance and prevent falls by helping to restore functionality to the vestibular system.\n\n    VRT is not always successful. Major considerations that must be addressed when deciding upon this particular Vertigo treatment include:\n\nThe patient's age \nThe ability of the patient to remember and follow directions. \nThe general physical and mental health of the patient \nThe patient's physical strength \nVertigo Medication\n    If the underlying causes of Vertigo are diagnosed to be an ear infections that is caused by the presence of bacteria, the the doctor may prescribe antibiotics such as amoxicillin or ceftriaxone. \n\n    The problem with taking these types of antibiotics, other than the expense of the prescription, is that they have produced side effects in many people including allergic reaction like shortness of breath; throat closure; hives; facial, lips and tongue swelling, seizures, severe watery diarrhea and abdominal cramps. Some patients have even reported unusual bleeding.\n\n    A type of Vertigo known as Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo, which is believed to be caused by a calcium buildup in the semicircular canals of the inner ear, is frequently treated with a drug called meclizine or Antivert. Side effects of this Vertigo medication may include drowsiness, dry mouth, and blurred vision.\n\n    When meclizine does not work, the doctor will try certain benzodiazepines such as clonazepam, or antihistamines such as promethazine. Side effects of these drugs include drowsiness, lack of coordination, confusion, fatigue, insomnia, and tremors.\n\nVertigo Surgery\n    If the Vertigo symptoms are caused by an ear infection, and those infections become chronic, the doctor may opt to perform a surgical procedure whereby an incision is made in the eardrum and a small tube is placed in the incision which prevents fluid and bacteria from building up inside of the ear.\n\n    I know you're wondering is their a better way, a safer, faster or more efficient way you can permanently deal with your Vertigo. \n \n Finally, You Have A Real Answer, Equitab?\n \nHow Equitab\u2122 is Different for You\n    You only need five minutes and one simple solution for your Vertigo. Equitab\u2122 is the only 100% natural product that works to reduce the symptoms of Vertigo as well as decrease the chances of them reoccurring.\n\nIt's amazing how this simple solution was overlooked for so long before it was brought to you. \n\nHow Equitab\u2122 Was Discovered \n     You'll be shocked when you learn how and why Equitab\u2122 was first made and used. Originally it was used by a small group of test subjects who suffered the symptoms of Vertigo including nausea, vomiting, dizziness, lightheadedness, faintness, and unsteadiness.\n\n     Once the Scientists at Selmedica Healthcare, the people who make Equitab\u2122, saw how fast these people received relief from their misery, the product was made available to the public. Since then thousands and thousands of Vertigo sufferers have turned to Equitab\u2122 for Vertigo relief. Because it worked for them you know it will work for you --guaranteed!\n\nWhat Equitab\u2122 Does For You\n     You have to understand that Equitab\u2122 is 100% natural and 100% unique. It is made from a precisely balanced blend of Ginkgo extracts, dried rhizome of ginger, kelp, and cayenne. \n\n     This unique, all-natural Vertigo fighting formula works together"

        "A hiccup or hiccough (generally pronounced \"hiccup\" independent of the spelling) is an involuntary spasm of the diaphragm; typically this repeats several times a minute. The sudden rush of air into the lungs causes the glottis to close, creating the \"hic\" noise. A bout of hiccups generally resolves by itself, although many home remedies are in circulation to shorten the duration, and medication is occasionally necessary. By extension, the term \"hiccup\" is also used to describe a small and unrepeated aberration in an otherwise consistent pattern. The medical term is singultus.\n\nWhile many cases develop spontaneously, hiccups are known to develop often in specific situations, such as eating too quickly, taking a cold drink while eating a hot meal, eating very hot or spicy food, laughing vigorously or coughing, or drinking an excess of an alcoholic beverage. Hiccups may be caused by pressure to the phrenic nerve by other anatomical structures, or rarely by tumors.",

        "Hiccups are sudden, involuntary contractions of the diaphragm muscle. As the muscle contracts repeatedly, the opening between your vocal cords snaps shut to check the inflow of air and makes the hiccup sound.

        "The first step in preventing chapped lips is to stop licking. Constant wetting and drying sucks the moisture from lips' outer layer, causing them to feel dry, which prompts more licking, creating a vicious cycle. Dehydrated lips are also more susceptible to dry, windy conditions. \n-- A moisturizing lip balm, especially those containing dimethicone, will help retain natural moisture and protect dry, chapped lips. \n-- Drinking lots of water will help prevent dehydration, which may contribute to chapped lips and dry skin. \n-- Smoothing a generous coating of lip balm on lips before bed will help to moisturize lips while you sleep. \n-- The sun's UV rays are responsible for 90 percent of visible damage we commonly attribute to aging. A lip balm that contains a sun protection factor (SPF) of at least 15 will help prevent sunburn during outdoor activities, and may reduce the risks of skin aging, skin cancer, and other harmful effects of the sun. \n-- Regular lipstick products, especially some long-wearing varieties, may feel drying. A base coat of lip balm will add needed moisture during winter months. \n-- If lips become chapped, avoid wearing lipsticks while lips are recovering as drying products in color pigments may irritate chapped lips. Also keep acidic foods from touching delicate lips until they've healed. \n-- Lip exfoliators such as Softlips Nightly Care(TM) buff away dry, dead skin cells and stimulate growth of new, vibrant cells. The interactive Beta Hydroxy formula of Softlips Nightly Care(TM) conditions lips that may be sensitive to strong Alpha Hydroxy chemical peels, and the overnight system helps reduce concern about sun damage to freshly exfoliated skin. \n\nFor more information and tips, see the website below!",

One more thing, while kissing an HIV+ person may be safe, you may want to watch out for anyone who may have MONO or HERPES.",
        "Causes of HIV/AIDS \nCause of HIV/AIDS: AIDS is caused by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). By killing or damaging cells of the body's immune system, HIV progressively destroys the body's ability to fight infections and certain cancers. People diagnosed with AIDS may get life-threatening diseases called opportunistic infections, which are caused by microbes such as viruses or bacteria that usually do not make healthy people sick. 1 \n\nCause statistics for HIV/AIDS: The following are statistics from various sources about the causes of HIV/AIDS: \n\n57.5% of adult males with AIDS contracted it through sex with other men in the US 2001 (US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, US Census Bureau) \n24% of adult males with AIDS contracted it through injecting drugs in the US 2001 (US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, US Census Bureau) \n9.5% of adult males with AIDS contracted it through heterosexual contact in the US 2001 (US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, US Census Bureau) \n38% of adult females with AIDS contracted it through injecting drugs in the US 2001 (US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, US Census Bureau) \n59% of adult females with AIDS contracted it through heterosexual contact in the US 2001 (US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, US Census Bureau) \nCause details for HIV/AIDS: HIV disease is characterized by a gradual deterioration of immune function. Most notably, crucial immune cells called CD4+ T cells are disabled and killed during the typical course of infection. These cells, sometimes called \"T-helper cells,\" play a central role in the immune response, signaling other cells in the immune system to perform their special functions. \n\nA healthy, uninfected person usually has 800 to 1,200 CD4+ T cells per cubic millimeter (mm3) of blood. During HIV infection, the number of these cells in a person's blood progressively declines. When a person's CD4+ T cell count falls below 200/mm3, he or she becomes particularly vulnerable to the opportunistic infections and cancers that typify AIDS, the end stage of HIV disease. People with AIDS often suffer infections of the lungs, intestinal tract, brain, eyes and other organs, as well as debilitating weight loss, diarrhea, neurologic conditions and cancers such as Kaposi's sarcoma and certain types of lymphomas. \n\nMost scientists think that HIV causes AIDS by directly inducing the death of CD4+ T cells or interfering with their normal function, and by triggering other events that weaken a person's immune function. For example, the network of signaling molecules that normally regulates a person's immune response is disrupted during HIV disease, impairing a person's ability to fight other infections. The HIV-mediated destruction of the lymph nodes and related immunologic organs also plays a major role in causing the immunosuppression seen in people with AIDS.\n\nCHECK OUT THE WHOLE INFORMATION AT THE SOURCED WEBSITE!"

Delve into your daily fluid needs to learn how your body uses water and what factors may increase \u2014 or decrease \u2014 your water requirements.\n\nLack of water can lead to dehydration, a condition that occurs when you don't have enough water in your body to carry on normal functions. Even mild dehydration \u2014 as little as a 1 percent to 2 percent loss of your body weight \u2014 can sap your energy and make you tired. Dehydration poses a particular health risk for the very young and the very old. Signs and symptoms of dehydration include:\n\nExcessive thirst \nFatigue \nHeadache \nDry mouth \nLittle or no urination \nMuscle weakness \nDizziness \nLightheadedness \n\nEvery day you lose water through sweating \u2014 noticeable and unnoticeable \u2014 exhaling, urinating and bowel movements. For your body to function properly, you need to replace this water by consuming beverages and foods that contain water. So how much water, or more precisely fluid, do you need?\n\nThis isn't an easy question to answer. A healthy adult's daily fluid intake can vary widely. Most people drink fluid to quench thirst, to supply perceived water needs and \"out of habit.\" At least three approaches estimate total fluid (water) needs for healthy, sedentary adults living in a temperate climate.\n\nReplacement approach. The average urine output for adults is 1.5 liters a day. You lose close to an additional liter of water a day through breathing, sweating and bowel movements. Food usually accounts for 20 percent of your fluid intake, so you if you consume 2 liters of water or other beverages a day (a little more than 8 cups), along with your normal diet, you can replace the lost fluids. \nEight 8-ounce glasses of water a day. Another approach to water intake is the \"8 x 8 rule\" \u2014 drink eight 8-ounce glasses of water a day (about 1.9 liters). The rule could also be stated, \"drink eight 8-ounce glasses of fluid a day,\" as all fluids count toward the daily total. Though this approach isn't supported by scientific evidence, many people use this basic rule as a guideline for how much water and other fluids to drink. \nDietary recommendations. The Institute of Medicine recommends that men consume 3 liters (about 13 cups) of total beverages a day and women consume 2.2 liters (about 9 cups) of total beverages a day. These guidelines are based on national food surveys that assessed people's average fluid intakes.",

This is cause by contraction of some of the back muscles related to stress such as Trapezius, semispinalis capitits, splenious capitis etc.. Basically this tension that most probably is triggered by some sort of stress puts pressure on a spinal nerve coming out of the spinal cord that inhibits the optimum potential of your body to function properly.. Chiropractic uses a non invasive procedure to remove that nerve interference and permit the body to function in harmony without obstruction.. Chiropractic is proven and documented by peer reviewed journals to be effective with patients that have headaches.. What you don't want to do is rely on medication because your body will adapt to the chemicals and you'll always have to take them to feel normal.. Don't forget about the side effects that all medications have especially to the liver!!!! Get your spine checked and the headaches will go away..",

If you had contact with someone who you think might have had herpes, you should get tested as soon as you do see any kind of lesion, where they can sample the fluid directly and test it for herpes virus.

In the first case, foodstuffs are broken down by enzymes, stomach acids, and intestinal bacteria in order for the energy in them to be made available to the body. Through the processes of digestion and fermentation, gases can be liberated from what's eaten. In the second case, air that a person swallows from eating, drinking, breathing, chewing gum, and being stressed, among other ways of entry, that's not expelled during a burp travels through the stomach and intestine, transforming into fart-ready mode. In either case, the gases flow down through the rest of the digestive tract and eventually exit the body - Poof! Ping! Pfft! Toot-toot! Kaboom! - expelled as a fart, or farts. And this silent or noisy expulsion of air can help bring about some relief and comfort from a buildup of gas within the lower part of the body.\"",

Diphtheria was once quite common, but has now largely been eradicated in developed nations (in the United States for instance, there have been fewer than 5 cases a year reported since 1980, as the DPT (Diphtheria-Tetanus-Pertussis) vaccine is given to all school children). Boosters of the vaccine are recommended for adults because the benefits of the vaccine decrease with age; they are particularly recommended for those travelling to areas where the disease has not been eradicated yet.\n\nSigns and symptoms\n\nThe respiratory form has an incubation time of 1-4 days. Symptoms include fatigue, fever, a mild sore throat and problems swallowing. Children infected have symptoms that include nausea, vomiting, chills, and a high fever, although some do not show symptoms until the infection has progressed further.\n\nLow blood pressure may develop in some patients. Longer-term effects include cardiomyopathy and peripheral neuropathy (sensory type)[1].",
        "Diphtheria is a contagious illness caused by a type of bacteria. It can cause breathing and swallowing problems and can damage the heart and central nervous system (brain and spinal cord).",
        "Diphtheria (dif-THEER-e-uh) is a serious bacterial infection, usually affecting the mucous membranes of your nose and throat. The disease typically causes a bad sore throat, fever, swollen glands and weakness. But the hallmark sign is a thick, gray covering in the back of your throat that can make breathing difficult. Diphtheria can also infect your skin.\n\nSigns and symptoms of diphtheria may include:\n\nA sore throat and hoarseness \nPainful swallowing \nSwollen glands (enlarged lymph nodes) in your neck \nA thick, gray membrane covering your throat and tonsils \nDifficulty breathing or rapid breathing \nNasal discharge \nFever and chills \nMalaise \n\nFor more infor please visit this URL: Choose Diptheria."

The virus, which is called hepatitis B virus (HBV), can cause lifelong infection, cirrhosis (scarring) of the liver, liver cancer, liver failure, and death. \n Hepatitis C: is a liver disease caused by the hepatitis C virus (HCV), which is found in the blood of persons who have the disease. HCV is spread by contact with the blood of an infected person.\n\n\n \n Hepatitis D: is a liver disease caused by the hepatitis D virus (HDV), a defective virus that needs the hepatitis B virus to exist. Hepatitis D virus (HDV) is found in the blood of persons infected with the virus. \n Hepatitis E: is a liver disease caused by the hepatitis E virus (HEV) transmitted in much the same way as hepatitis A virus.

        "All tea comes from the same plant--black, green, and oolong teas all have the same parents. The difference in the teas lies in how the teas are prepared after picking. Black and oolong tea are fermented, but Green tea is not. Therefore the active constituents remain unaltered in green tea. The most important ingredient in green tea is the phytonutrient eppigallocatchin or EGCG for short. This substance is a polyphenolic compound that acts as an antioxidant.\n\nWhat does EGCG do?\nResearch has shown that these polyphenolic antioxidants protects the body against cardiovascular disease, and promote a healthy immune system. However in this new research, Professor Roger Thornley in England states, \u201cWe have shown for the first time that EGCG, which is present in green tea at relatively high concentrations, inhibits the enzyme DHFR or dihydrofolate which is a recognized, established target for anti-cancer drugs. This is the first time to our knowledge a known target for an anti-cancer drug has been identified as being inhibited by EGCG.\u201d The scientist continued by saying that EGCG is probably just one of a number of anti-cancer mechanisms in green tea.\n\nIt's also said to help reduce bad Cholestrol among many other help benefits which are still being researched. You will find several books and online claims about green tea - most of them are true but not all of them have been published in scientific journals yet because enough research has not been done yet.\n\nIn short - it's good for you!",

        "PROPERTIES OF AFLATOXIN AND IT PRODUCING FUNGI\n\n\nReddy,S.V. and Farid Waliyar \n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMany agricultural commodities are vulnerable to attack by a group of fungi that are able to produce toxic metabolites called mycotoxins. Among various mycotoxins, aflatoxins have assumed significance due to their deleterious effects on human beings, poultry and livestock. The aflatoxin problem was first recognized in 1960, when there was severe outbreak of a disease referred as \"Turkey 'X' Disease\" in UK, in which over 100,000 turkey poults were died. The cause of the disease was shown due to toxins in peanut meal infected with Aspergillus flavus and the toxins were named as aflatoxins.\n\nNatural occurrence:\n\nFood products contaminated with aflatoxins include cereal (maize, sorghum, pearl millet, rice, wheat), oilseeds (groundnut, soybean, sunflower, cotton), spices (chillies, black pepper, coriander, turmeric, zinger), tree nuts (almonds, pistachio, walnuts, coconut) and milk. \n\nPhysical and chemical properties:\n\nAflatoxins are potent toxic, carcinogenic, mutagenic, immunosuppressive agents, produced as secondary metabolites by the fungus Aspergillus flavus and A. parasiticus on variety of food products. Among 18 different types of aflatoxins identified, major members are aflatoxin B1, B2, G1 and G2. Aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) is normally predominant in amount in cultures as well as in food products. Pure AFB1 is pale-white to yellow crystalline, odorless solid. Aflatoxins are soluble in methanol, chloroform, actone, acetonitrile. A. flavus typically produces AFB1 and AFB2, where as A. parasiticus produce AFG1 and AFG2 as well as AFB1 and AFB2. Four other aflatoxins M1, M2, B2A, G2A which may be produced in minor amounts were subsequently isolated from cultures of A. flavus and A. parasiticus. A number of closely related compounds namely aflatoxin GM1, parasiticol and aflatoxicol are also produced by A. flavus. Aflatoxin M1and M2 are major metabolites of aflatoxin B1 and B2 respectively, found in milk of animals that have consumed feed contaminated with aflatoxins.",
        "Aflatoxins are naturally occurring mycotoxins that are produced by many species of Aspergillus; but most notably Aspergillus flavus and Aspergillus parasiticus. Aflatoxins are toxic and carcinogenic to animals, including humans. After entering the body, aflatoxins are metabolized by the liver to an intermediate reactive, aflatoxin M1, an epoxide.",
        "if you live in the united states, who cares?  THis is a disese of 3rd world countries where wheat and other such products spoil and have a fungus in them which produces toxins which promote the formation of liver cancer.  Not a problem in this country.",

A double clinical study of patients with nonspecific sore throat tested licorice tea (throat coat brand) and found a significant reduction in throat pain as compared with placebo in as little as 10 minutes.  Patients were told to consume this tea 4-6 times per day.\n\nLicorice tea will probably also help with the pain of the mouth sore, even if it does not make the sore heal faster, but it might help with that too.\n\nLicorice has also been shown to have anti-inflammatory effects, which may help with the blister.\n\nOne warning, though,  is that you should not consume too much licorice, especially if you have blood pressure problems.  A case report from the Netherlands reported that excessive consumption of licorice tea (about 3 liters per day, so a lot) can temproarily raise blood pressure.  This rise in blood pressure may drop back down after licorice tea stops being consumed, but it may take time."

        "Multiple sclerosis is an autoimmune disease that affects the central nervous system (the brain and spinal cord). \nMultiple sclerosis (MS) usually affects woman more than men. The disorder most commonly begins between ages 20 and 40, but can strike at any age.\n\nThe exact cause is not known, but MS is believed to result from damage to the myelin sheath, the protective material which surrounds nerve cells. It is a progressive disease, meaning the damage gets worse over time. Inflammation destroys the myelin, leaving multiple areas of scar tissue (sclerosis). The inflammation occurs when the body's own immune cells attack the nervous system.\n\nThe inflammation causes nerve impulses to slow down or become blocked, leading to the symptoms of MS. Repeated episodes, or flare ups, of inflammation can occur along any area of the brain and spinal cord.\n\nSymptoms vary because the location and extent of each attack varies. Usually episodes that last days, weeks, or months alternate with times of reduced or no symptoms (remission).\n\nRecurrence (relapse) is common although non-stop progression without periods of remission may also occur.\n\nResearchers are not sure what triggers an attack. Patients with MS typically have a higher number of immune cells than a healthy person, which suggests that an immune response might play a role. The most common theories point to a virus or genetic defect, or a combination of both. There also appears to be a genetic link to the disease. MS is more likely to occur in northern Europe, the northern United States, southern Australia, and New Zealand than in other areas. Geographic studies indicate there may be an environmental factor involved.\n\nPeople with a family history of MS and those who live in a geographical area with a higher incidence rate for MS have a higher risk of the disease.\n\nCheck out this article with excellent illustrations:\nhttp://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000737.htm",

        "Thirst and drinking function to maintain body water balance and are basic to survival. Thirst is often associated with a dry unpleasant-tasting mouth and the feeling of a need to obtain water; it can result from dehydration, decreased vascular volume, dry mouth, pharmacologic agents, or inappropriate activation of the thirst mechanism. Drinking involves the motor activities that culminate in ingestion of liquids. Thirst sensation and drinking are influenced by many factors, including the temperature and taste of a liquid. Thirst may be discomforting in persons with limited fluid intake, diminished in some elderly persons, and inappropriate in persons who are compulsive water drinkers. Although nurses are commonly confronted with client complaints of thirst, there has been minimal nursing research that relates to assessment of thirst and drinking behaviors, nursing diagnoses for thirst, or nursing interventions for persons with altered thirst or drinking behaviors.\n\nThirst is the sensation indicating the body's need for water. Dry or salty food and dry, dusty air may induce such a sensation by depleting moisture in the mucous membranes of the mouth and throat. Relief through ingestion of water is only temporary, however, if thirst results from a generalized depletion of water in the system. About three fourths of the body is composed of fluids, and the average adult requires 21/2 qt (2.4 liters) of fluid per day, supplied by water, other beverages, and foods. Depriving the body of water interferes with its metabolism and functions, causing dehydration, which is eventually fatal. The unnatural thirst that accompanies fever, diabetes, and other disorders is caused by a rapid reduction of the body fluids. The sensation of thirst is controlled by osmoreceptors in the hypothalamus in the brain. Dehydration of the cells triggers the posterior pituitary to releast the antidiuretic hormone (ADH).",
        "To put it simply, you loose water, it concentrates your blood and your brain detects this concentration (osmolality) and sends a signal to drink and to also limit excretion of water.  Its caused by the salt concentration of our blood as sensed by the brain.  IF you are thirsty, you are 1% dehyradted."
